Largely unbeknownst to the general public, executives and top
journalists of almost all major US media outlets have long been members
of the influential Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

Established in 1921 as a private, bipartisan organization to [‚Äúawaken
America to its worldwide
responsibilities‚Äù](http://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/21/archives/is-it-a-club-seminar-presidium-invisible-government-the-council-on-.html),
the CFR and its close to 5000 elite members for decades have shaped US
foreign policy and public discourse about it. As a well-known Council
member famously
[explained](http://carnegieendowment.org/1998/06/01/benevolent-empire-pub-275),
they transformed the American republic into a global empire, albeit a
‚Äúbene¬≠volent‚Äù one.

Based on official membership rosters, the following illustration depicts
for the first time the extensive media network of the CFR and its two
major international affiliate organizations: the [Bilderberg
Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group) (mainly covering
the US and Europe) and the [Trilateral
Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateral_commission)
(covering North America, Europe and East Asia), both established by
Council leaders to foster elite cooperation at the global level.

[![CFR Media
Network](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cfr-media-network-hdv-spr.png?w=736)](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cfr-media-network-hdv-spr.png)[Click

üîé](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cfr-media-network-hdv-spr.png)

In a column entitled [‚ÄúRuling Class
Journalists‚Äù](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1993/10/30/ruling-class-journalists/761e7bf8-025d-474e-81cb-92dcf271571e/),
former *Washington Post* senior editor and ombudsman Richard Harwood
described the Council and its members approvingly as ‚Äúthe nearest thing
we have to a ruling establishment in the United States‚Äù.

Harwood continued: ‚ÄúThe membership of these journalists in the Council,
however they may think of themselves, is an acknowledgment of their
active and important role in public affairs and of their ascension into
the American ruling class. They do not merely analyze and interpret
foreign policy for the United States; they help make it. () They are
part of that establishment whether they like it or not, sharing most of
its values and world views.‚Äù

Media researcher Noam Chomsky explained this aspect in an [essay
from 1997](https://chomsky.info/199710__/): ‚ÄúThe point is that they
wouldn‚Äôt be there unless they had already demonstrated that nobody has
to tell them what to write because they are going say the right thing
anyway. () They have been through the socialization system.‚Äù

However, media personalities constitute only about five percent of the
overall CFR network. As the following illustration shows, key members of
the private Council on Foreign Relations have included:

  - several US Presidents and Vice Presidents of both parties;
  - almost all Secretaries of State, Defense, and the Treasury;
  - many high-ranking commanders of the US military and NATO;
  - some of the most influential Members of Congress (notably in foreign
    & security policy);
  - almost all National Security Advisors, CIA Directors, Ambassadors to
    the U.N., Chairs of the Federal Reserve, Presidents of the World
    Bank, and Directors of the National Economic Council;
  - many prominent academics, especially in key fields such as Economics
    and Political Science;
  - many top executives of Wall Street, policy think tanks,
    universities, NGOs, and Hollywood;
  - as well as the key members of both the 9/11 Commission and the
    Warren Commission (JFK)

Harvard economist and Kennedy supporter, John K. Galbraith,
[confirmed](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/73633/the-best-and-the-brightest-by-david-halberstam/9780449908709/)
the Council‚Äôs influence: ‚ÄúThose of us who had worked for the Kennedy
election were tolerated in the government for that reason and had a say,
but foreign policy was still with the Council on Foreign Relations
people.‚Äù

Princeton University professor and former CFR member Stephen F. Cohen
[described](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-american-bipartisan-policy-establishment-declares-its-second-cold-war-vs-russia-after-years-of-denying-it/)
the Council as ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs single most important non-governmental
foreign-policy organization‚Äù, whose primary role is to ‚Äúdefine the
accepted, legitimate, orthodox parameters of discussion.‚Äù According to
Cohen, ‚Äúthe CFR really is what the Soviets used to call the very
top-level of the Nomenklatura.‚Äù

And no less than John J. McCloy, the longtime chairman of the Council
and advisor to several US presidents,
[recalled](http://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/21/archives/is-it-a-club-seminar-presidium-invisible-government-the-council-on-.html)
about his time in Washington: ‚ÄúWhenever we needed a man we thumbed
through the roll of the Council members and put through a call to New
York \[i.e., the CFR headquarters\].‚Äù

[![CFR American
Empire](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/cfr-imperial-council-hdv.png?w=736)](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/cfr-imperial-council-hdv.png)
1945 to 2017: CFR members in key positions of the American Empire  
[Click to enlarge
üîé](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/cfr-imperial-council-hdv.png)

German news magazine *Der Spiegel* once
[described](http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/41389590)
the CFR as the ‚Äúmost influential private institution of the United
States and the Western world‚Äù and a ‚Äúpolitburo of capitalism‚Äù. Both the
Roman-inspired logo of the Council (top right in the illustration
above), as well as its slogan (*ubique* ‚Äì omnipresent), appear to
emphasize this ambition.

In his famous article about [‚ÄúThe American
Establishment‚Äù](http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/WQ_VOL2_SU_1978_Article_05.pdf),
political columnist Richard H. Rovere noted: ‚ÄúThe directors of the CFR
make up a sort of Presidium for that part of the Establishment that
guides our destiny as a nation. () \[I\]t rarely fails to get one of its
members, or at least one of its allies, into the White House. In fact,
it generally is able to see to it that both nominees are men acceptable
to it.‚Äù

Until recently, this assessment indeed was justified. Thus, in 1993
former CFR director George H.W. Bush was followed by CFR member Bill
Clinton, who in turn was followed by CFR ‚Äúfamily member‚Äù George W. Bush.
In 2008, CFR member John McCain lost against CFR candidate of choice,
Barack Obama, who
[received](http://observer.com/2016/10/obama-makes-first-appearance-in-wikileaks-receives-admin-list-from-big-banker/)
the names of his entire Cabinet already one month prior to his election
by CFR Senior Fellow (and Citigroup banker) Michael Froman. Froman later
negotiated the TPP and TTIP trade agreements, before returning to the
CFR as a Distinguished Fellow.

It was not until the 2016 election that the Council couldn‚Äôt,
apparently, prevail. At any rate, not yet.

**Update 2018**: In January 2018, a few weeks before his internet access
was cut off, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange
[shared](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/assange-tweet.png)
the above CFR media chart on his Twitter account.

**Update 2019**: It became known that deceased billionaire sex
trafficker Jeffrey Epstein had been, until 2009, a member and
[donor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/council-on-foreign-relations-another-beneficiary-of-epstein-largesse-grapples-with-how-to-handle-his-donations/2019/09/10/1d5630e2-d324-11e9-86ac-0f250cc91758_story.html)
of both the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission.
