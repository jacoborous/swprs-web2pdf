\section{Covid-19 Virus Origin: The Mojiang Miners
Passage~Hypothesis}\label{covid-19-virus-origin-the-mojiang-miners-passage-hypothesis}}

Virologist Jonathan Latham and geneticist Allison Wilson have proposed
\href{https://www.independentsciencenews.org/commentaries/a-proposed-origin-for-sars-cov-2-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/}{a
new hypothesis} for the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Covid-19
pandemic.

It has been known since February that a bat virus called RaTG13,
collected by the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in 2013, is the
closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2.

It has been known since May (to some) that RaTG13, previously known as
BtCoV/4991,
\href{https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/seven-year-covid-trail-revealed-l5vxt7jqp}{was
found} in bat feces in a mineshaft near Mojiang in southwest China,
after six miners fell ill with Covid19-like pneumonia and three of them
eventually died.

The WIV itself didn't disclose this link, however. On the contrary, in a
March 2020 interview the famous WIV ``bat woman'' Shi Zhengli
\href{https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/}{falsely
claimed} ``a fungus'' had caused the miners' illness.

It is also known that RaTG13, despite its 96\% similarity, cannot be the
direct ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, as natural mutations in the environment
would have taken at least several decades. But it has been shown
computationally that RaTG13 can itself already infect human lung cells
to some extent.

Finally, it is
\href{https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6981198-Analysis-of-Six-Patients-With-Unknown-Viruses.html}{known
that} the sick Mojiang miners, exhibiting severe Covid19-like pneumonia,
were hospitalized \emph{for up to four months} before being either
discharged or dying back in 2012.

Latham and Wilson now propose that the Mojiang miners were originally
infected by RaTG13 and/or similar coronaviruses during their up to two
week stay in the mineshaft inhaling aerosols from bat feces. RaTG13 then
turned into SARS-CoV-2 through mutations and/or recombinations \emph{in
the lungs of the miners} during their up to four month stay in the
hospital (the Mojiang miners passage).

Thus the infected lungs of the miners may have served as a `human
incubator' enabling RaTG13 to adapt to both the human ACE2 cell receptor
and the human immune system in just four months instead of several
decades as would have been expected in a natural (animal) environment.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2012/2013 received tissue and blood
samples of the surviving or dead miners that may already have included
what is now known as SARS-CoV-2. WIV virologists may then have been
waiting five more years, until the completion of their BSL-4 (high
security) lab in 2018, before beginning to do research on what is now
known as SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 may then have escaped, probably in autumn 2019, from the WIV
BSL-4 lab, perhaps through an infected lab worker, initiating what is
now a global coronavirus pandemic.

This, in short, is the Latham-Wilson
\href{https://www.independentsciencenews.org/commentaries/a-proposed-origin-for-sars-cov-2-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/}{Mojiang
Miners Passage (MMP)} hypothesis. It can explain most or all of the
unusual properties of SARS-CoV-2, including its very strong binding to
human ACE2 cell receptors and its very low mutation rate, without having
to assume ``gain of function'' research (i.e. genetic engineering) ---
although the hypothesis doesn't exclude this, either.

Interestingly, archive entries show that the origin of RaTG13 in a
Chinese database
\href{https://twitter.com/TheSeeker268/status/1286327367019839490}{was
changed} from ``lung fluid'' (from the miners) to ``bat feces'' in July
2020 without any annotation. In addition, the WIV
\href{https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/seven-year-covid-trail-revealed-l5vxt7jqp}{claimed
that} the RaTG13 sample had ``disintegrated'' during analyses in early
2020 and was no longer available (and thus no longer verifiable).
