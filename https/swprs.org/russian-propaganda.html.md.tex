\section{Russian Propaganda}\label{russian-propaganda}}

\includegraphics{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kreml.png?w=736}

How does Russian propaganda work, and what makes it so effective?

The basic principle is universal and focuses on dissonances and
discrepancies in the power structure of target countries, combined with
the positive representation of one's own ambitions.

The most important technique to achieve these goals is not ``fake news''
or ``disinformation'' -- which can be refuted -- but a skillful choice
of topics, aspects and interview partners. As one doesn't promise
neutral journalism, the audience doesn't expect it, either.

This approach is most effective when an incoherence or incompleteness of
Western reporting can be proven and as a result confidence in the
Western media system as a whole can be shaken -- consider slogans and
formats such as ``Question More'' or ``The Missing Part''.

While seemingly progressive, the overarching strategic goal is to
provide media support for Russian foreign policy -- in peacetime as well
as in wartime. This can be observed particularly well in volatile
diplomatic relations, for example with countries such as France, Israel,
Turkey or the US.

One should also keep in mind that Russian foreign state media outlets
are financed by a government whose income largely depends on the
international export of oil, gas, and arms.

For Western critics from a wide variety of political backgrounds, such a
programme may nevertheless be quite attractive. Western media, on the
other hand, find themselves in a serious dilemma: should they accept,
ignore, or combat Russian-sponsored criticism?

The alleged Russian social media and
\href{https://consortiumnews.com/2018/08/13/too-big-to-fail-russia-gate-one-year-after-vips-showed-a-leak-not-a-hack/}{hacking
operations} to influence foreign elections, however, remain
\href{https://www.thenation.com/article/russiagate-elections-interference/}{unproven}.
Moreover, in 2018 a consulting firm tasked by US Congress with
investigating these operations was itself

faking a ``Russian botnet'' in order to manipulate a US senate election.

Actual
\href{https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/operation-denver-kgb-and-stasi-disinformation-regarding-aids}{disinformation}
is employed by the Russian side mainly when the facts are difficult to
verify. More often than not, affiliated third parties are used to
disseminate such questionable stories.
