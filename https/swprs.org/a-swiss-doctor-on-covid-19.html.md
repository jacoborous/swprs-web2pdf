Fully referenced facts about Covid-19, provided by experts in the field,
to help our readers make a realistic risk assessment. (Regular updates

*

**“The only means to fight the plague is honesty.” (**Albert Camus,
1947)****

#### Overview

1.  According to the latest immunological studies, the overall
    **lethality** of Covid-19 (IFR) is [about 0.1%
    to 0.3%](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/) and thus
    in the range of a severe influenza (flu).
2.  For people at high risk or high exposure (including health care
    workers), [early or
    prophylactic](https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/)
    **treatment** is essential to prevent progression of the disease.
3.  In countries like the US, the UK, and also Sweden (without a
    lockdown), **overall mortality** since the beginning of the year [is
    in the range
    of](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/#overall-mortality)
    a strong influenza season; in countries like Germany and
    Switzerland, overall mortality so far is in the range of a mild
    influenza season.
4.  In most places, the **risk of death** for the general population of
    school and working age is in the range of [a daily car ride to
    work](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054361v1).
    The risk was initially overestimated because many people with only
    mild or no symptoms were not taken into account.
5.  Up to 80% of all test-positive persons [remain
    symptom-free](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1375). Even among
    70-79 year olds,
    [about 60%](https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e/9407-covid-dp-fe-01.html)
    remain **symptom-free**. About 95% of all people develop at most
    [moderate
    symptoms](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/#hospitalizations).
6.  Up to 60% of all persons [may already
    have](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(20\)30610-3) a
    certain cellular **background immunity** to the new coronavirus due
    to contact with previous coronaviruses (i.e. cold viruses). The
    initial assumption that there was no immunity against the new
    coronavirus was not correct.
7.  The **median age** of the deceased in most countries (including
    Italy) is [over 80
    years](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/#age) (e.g.
    86 years in Sweden) and [only
    about 4%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-26/italy-says-96-of-virus-fatalities-suffered-from-other-illnesses)
    of the deceased had no serious preconditions. The age and risk
    profile of deaths thus essentially corresponds to [normal
    mortality](https://www.vienna.at/analyse-zeigt-covid-19-opferkurve-entspricht-normaler-mortalitaet/6581246).
8.  In many countries, [up to two
    thirds](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/#care-homes)
    of all extra deaths occurred in **nursing homes**, which do not
    benefit from a general lockdown. Moreover, in many cases it is [not
    clear](https://www.hsj.co.uk/commissioning/thousands-of-extra-deaths-outside-hospital-not-attributed-to-covid-19/7027459.article)
    whether these people really died from Covid-19 or from weeks of
    [extreme stress and
    isolation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/covid-19-causing-10000-dementia-deaths-beyond-infections-research-says).
9.  Up to 30% of all **additional deaths** may have been caused [not by
    Covid-19](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/analysisofdeathregistrationsnotinvolvingcoronaviruscovid19englandandwales28december2019to1may2020/technicalannex),
    but by the effects of the [lockdown, panic and
    fear](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/two-new-waves-deaths-break-nhs-new-analysis-warns/).
    For example, the treatment of heart attacks and strokes
    [decreased](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/well/live/coronavirus-doctors-hospitals-emergency-care-heart-attack-stroke.html)
    by up to 60% because many patients no longer dared to go to
    hospital.
10. Even in so-called **“Covid-19 deaths”** it is often [not
    clear](https://spectator.us/understand-report-figures-covid-deaths/)
    whether they died *from* or *with* coronavirus (i.e. from underlying
    diseases) or if they were counted as [“presumed
    cases”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0lIWZpiRU0) and not
    tested at all. However, official figures usually [do not
    reflect](https://www.hsj.co.uk/coronavirus/systematic-reviews-to-discover-true-cause-of-outbreak-deaths/7027491.article)
    this distinction.
11. Many media reports of **young and healthy people** dying from
    Covid-19 turned out to be false: many of these young people either
    [did not
    die](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8193487/Coroner-refuses-rule-COVID-19-cause-death-six-week-old-Connecticut-baby.html)
    from Covid-19, they had already been [seriously
    ill](https://sports.yahoo.com/spanish-football-coach-francisco-garcia-163153573.html)
    (e.g. from undiagnosed leukaemia), or they were in fact [109 instead
    of 9](https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Neunjaehrige-Corona-Tote-war-109-Jahre-alt-article21753784.html)
    years old. The claimed increase in Kawasaki disease in children also
    turned out [to be
    exaggerated](https://www.societi.org.uk/kawasaki-disease-covid-19/responding-to-press-coverage-28-april-2020/).
12. Most **Covid-19 symptoms** can also be caused by severe influenza
    (including pneumonia,
    [thrombosis](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091014111549.htm)
    and the temporary loss of the [sense of
    smell](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948436/)), but with severe
    Covid-19 these symptoms are indeed more frequent and more
    pronounced.
13. Strong increases in **regional mortality** can occur if there is a
    [collapse in the care of the elderly and
    sick](https://swprs.org/covid-19-a-report-from-italy/) as a result
    of infection or panic, or if there are additional risk factors such
    as [severe air
    pollution](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/air-pollution-may-be-key-contributor-to-covid-19-deaths-study).
    Questionable
    [regulations](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-safe-handling-of-bodies-or-persons-dying-from-COVID19.pdf)
    for dealing with the deceased sometimes led to [additional
    bottlenecks](https://www.globalresearch.ca/truth-behind-refrigerated-morgue-truck-stories/5711475)
    in funeral or cremation services.
14. In countries such as Italy and Spain, and to some extent the UK and
    the US, **hospital overloads** due to strong flu waves [are not
    unusual](https://off-guardian.org/2020/04/02/coronavirus-fact-check-1-flu-doesnt-overwhelm-our-hospitals/).
    Moreover, this year up to 15% of health care workers were [put into
    quarantine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/europe/coronavirus-europe-covid-19.html),
    even if they developed no symptoms.
15. The often shown exponential curves of **“corona cases”** are
    [misleading](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/),
    as the number of tests also increased exponentially. In most
    countries, the ratio of positive tests to tests overall (i.e. the
    positivity rate) remained [constant at 5%
    to 20%](https://swprs.org/rate-of-positive-covid19-tests/) or
    increased only slightly. In many countries, the peak of the spread
    was already reached well [before the
    lockdown](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8391141/Did-UKs-coronavirus-crisis-peak-lockdown.html).
16. Countries *without* **lockdowns**, such as
    [Japan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-22/did-japan-just-beat-the-virus-without-lockdowns-or-mass-testing),
    [South
    Korea](https://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-coronavirus-testing-death-rate-2020-3?op=1),
    [Belarus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesrodgerseurope/2020/04/04/in-belarus-lukashenko-has-his--own-ways-for-the-country-to-face-coronavirus/)
    and [Sweden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfN2JWifLCY), have [not
    experienced](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/15/sweden-coronavirus-rates-easing-despite-loose-rule/)
    a more negative course of events than many other countries. Sweden
    was even
    [praised](https://nypost.com/2020/04/29/who-lauds-sweden-as-model-for-resisting-coronavirus-lockdown/)
    by the WHO and now benefits from [higher
    immunity](https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown)
    compared to lockdown countries. 75% of Swedish deaths [happened
    in](https://www.thelocal.se/20200525/swedish-death-toll-passes-4000-as-coronavirus-cases-in-care-homes-start-to-fall)
    nursing facilities that weren’t protected fast enough.
17. The fear of a shortage of **ventilators** was
    [unjustified](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/06/covid19-are-ventilators-killing-people/).
    According to lung specialists, the invasive ventilation (intubation)
    of Covid-19 patients, which is partly done [out of
    fear](https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/northwell-health-probing-use-of-ventilators-for-covid-patients/)
    of spreading the virus, is in fact often
    [counterproductive](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/06/covid19-are-ventilators-killing-people/)
    and damaging to the lungs.
18. Various studies [have shown
    that](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions)
    the main **routes of transmission** of the virus are neither
    long-range aerosols (i.e. tiny particles *floating* in the air) [nor
    smear
    infections](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cdc-coronavirus-mainly-spreads-through-persontoperson-contact-and-does-not-spread-easily-on-contaminated-surfaces-153317029.html)
    (i.e. on surfaces), but *direct* contact and *droplets* produced
    when talking or coughing. However, in [some
    circumstances](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768396),
    indoor aerosol transmission appears to be possible.
19. There is still [little to no scientific
    evidence](https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/) for the
    effectiveness of **cloth face masks** in *healthy* and
    *asymptomatic* individuals. Experts warn that such masks may
    interfere with normal breathing and may become [“germ
    carriers”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-news-face-masks-increase-risk-infection-doctor-jenny-harries-a9396811.html)
    if used repeatedly.
20. Many **clinics** in Europe and the US remained [strongly
    underutilized](https://www.hsj.co.uk/acute-care/nhs-hospitals-have-four-times-more-empty-beds-than-normal/7027392.article)
    or [almost
    empty](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Stanford-hospital-system-to-cut-pay-20-furlough-15227591.php)
    during lockdowns and in some cases had to [send staff
    home](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/02/coronavirus-pandemic-jobs-us-health-care-workers-furloughed-laid-off/5102320002/).
    Millions of surgeries and therapies were
    [cancelled](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2020/05/covid-disruption-28-million-surgeries-cancelled.aspx),
    including many cancer screenings and organ transplants.
21. Several **media** were caught [trying to
    dramatize](https://nypost.com/2020/04/01/cbs-admits-to-using-footage-from-italy-in-report-about-nyc/)
    the situation in hospitals, sometimes even with [manipulative
    images](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbs-says-fake-news-wasnt-theirs-11588789238)
    and videos. In general, the [unprofessional
    reporting](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eci.13222)
    of many media maximized fear and panic in the population.
22. The **virus test kits** used internationally are [prone to
    errors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219885) and can
    produce false positive and false negative results. Moreover, the
    official virus test was [not clinically
    validated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_AyuhbnPOI) due to time
    pressure and may sometimes react positive to other common
    coronaviruses.
23. Numerous [internationally renowned
    experts](https://off-guardian.org/2020/03/24/12-experts-questioning-the-coronavirus-panic/)
    in the fields of virology, immunology and epidemiology consider the
    **measures** taken to be
    [counterproductive](https://off-guardian.org/2020/03/28/10-more-experts-criticising-the-coronavirus-panic/)
    and recommend rapid [natural
    immunization](https://off-guardian.org/2020/04/17/8-more-experts-questioning-the-coronavirus-panic/)
    of the general population and protection of risk groups.
24. At no time was there [a medical
    reason](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642\(20\)30095-X/fulltext)
    for the closure of **schools**, as the risk of disease and
    transmission in children is [extremely
    low](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/500349-science-says-open-the-schools).
    There is also [no medical
    reason](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article208075525/Corona-Kitas-und-Grundschulen-vollstaendig-oeffnen-uneingeschraenkt.html)
    for small classes, masks or ‘social distancing’ rules in schools.
25. Several medical experts
    [described](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/31/covid-19-vaccine-amazingly-close-why-am-i-so-worried/)
    express coronavirus **vaccines** as
    [unnecessary](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/no-vaccine-for-coronavirus-a-possibility/news-story/34e678ae205b50ea983cc64ab2943608)
    or even
    [dangerous](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9).
    Indeed, the vaccine against the [so-called swine
    flu](https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html#658c006c48e8)
    of 2009, for example, led to cases of [severe neurological
    damage](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brain-damaged-uk-victims-swine-flu-vaccine-get-60-million-compensation-1438572)
    and lawsuits in the millions. In the testing of new coronavirus
    vaccines, too, serious
    [complications](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/vaccine-trial-catastrophe-moderna-vaccine-has-20-serious-injury-rate-in-high-dose-group/)
    and
    [failures](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/05/16/did-the-oxford-covid-vaccine-work-in-monkeys-not-really/)
    have already been reported.
26. A global respiratory disease pandemic can indeed extend over
    [several
    seasons](https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic), but
    many studies of a **“second wave”** are based on [very unrealistic
    assumptions](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Fellay-Studie-Zweite-Corona-Welle-4726303.html),
    such as a constant risk of illness and death across all age groups.
27. In several places, nurses described an oftentimes [fatal medical
    **mis­manage­ment**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ)of
    Covid patients due to questionable [financial
    incentives](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/)
    and inappropriate medical protocols.
28. The number of people suffering from **unemployment**,
    [depression](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2020/04/03/coronavirus-indiana-how-get-help-mental-health-addiction/5104357002/)

#### August 2020

##### A. General part

##### **Pre-existing immunity against the new coronavirus**

At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was assumed that no
immunity against the new coronavirus existed in the population. This was
one of the main reasons behind the initial strategy of “flattening the
curve” by introducing stay-at-home orders.

From March and April onwards, however, the first studies showed that a
considerable part of the population already had a [certain
immunity](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(20\)30610-3) to
the new virus, acquired through contact with earlier coronaviruses
(common cold viruses).

Further important studies on this topic were published in July:

  - A [new study from
    Germany](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-35331/v1) came to
    the conclusion that up to 81% of people who have not yet had contact
    with the new coronavirus already have cross-reactive **T-cells** and
    thus a certain background immunity. This confirms earlier studies on
    T-cell immunity.
  - In addition, [a British
    study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.095414v2)
    found that up to 60% of children and adolescents and about 6% of
    adults already have cross-reactive **antibodies** against the new
    coronavirus, which were created by contact with previous
    coronaviruses. This is probably another important aspect in
    explaining the very low rate of disease in children and adolescents.
  - In the case of Singapore, a study published in the scientific
    journal Nature [concluded
    that](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z) people who
    contracted SARS-1 in 2002/2003 still had T-cells that were reactive
    against the new SARS-2 coronavirus 17 years later. In addition, the
    researchers found cross-reactive T-cells, which were produced by
    contact with other, *partly unknown coronaviruses*, in about half of
    the people who had neither contracted SARS-1 nor SARS-2. The
    researchers suspect that the different distribution of such
    coronaviruses and T-cells may help explain why some countries are
    less affected than others by the new corona virus, regardless of the
    political and medical measures taken.
  - Analysts have previously [pointed out
    that](https://twitter.com/boriquagato/status/1280212958392446977)
    many Pacific countries, and especially China’s neighbouring
    countries, have so far had very low Covid death rates, regardless of
    their population structure (young or old) and the measures taken
    (with or without lockdown, mass tests, masks, etc.). A possible
    explanation for this could be the spread of earlier coronaviruses.
  - Harvard immunologist Michael Mina explained that the “drop in
    antibody concentration” after Covid disease, dramatized by some
    media, was [“perfectly
    normal”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html)
    and “textbook”. The body ensures long-term immunity through T-cells
    and memory cells in the bone marrow, which can quickly produce new
    antibodies when needed.

**See also:** [Immunological studies on the new
coronavirus](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/)

##### **Other medical updates**

**Wuhan**: A Harvard modelling study in the scientific journal *Nature*
came to the conclusion that even in the Covid epicentre Wuhan, up to 87%
of the infections [went
unnoticed](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/study-finds-early-wuhan-covid-cases-largely-undetected/),
i.e. remained without symptoms or mild. This means that the Covid19
lethality (IFR) in Wuhan may also fall to about 0.1% or below. The
Nature study confirms an [earlier Japanese
study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v3) in
the journal *BMC Medicine*, which calculated an IFR of 0.12% for Wuhan
already back in March.

However, Chinese authorities couldn’t yet know this comparatively low
lethality in January and February and therefore built additional clinics
at short notice, many of which eventually remained [mostly
unused](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/what-chinas-empty-new-coronavirus-hospitals-say-about-its-secretive-system).
Only the systematic test results from South Korea and the cruise ship
Diamond Princess showed that the lethality of the new corona virus in
the general population is indeed lower than initially feared.

**Italy**: The Italian health authority ISS published [a new
analysis](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-study-idUSKCN24H2VZ)
of the cause of death in about 5000 corona patients. According to this
analysis, Covid was the *direct cause of death* in 89% of the cases. In
11%, other diseases such as heart problems, cancer or dementia were the
primary cause of death. Covid was the *sole cause of death* in 28% of
cases. It is also known that in [about 4% of the
deaths](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-26/italy-says-96-of-virus-fatalities-suffered-from-other-illnesses),
no medical preconditions were present.

**Covid mortality**: In May, the US health authority CDC published a
cautious “best estimate” of covid mortality (IFR) of 0.26% (assuming 35%
asymptomatic infections). In July, a [new IFR
of 0.65%](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html)
was published. However, this new value is not based on own calculations
or new studies, but [on a
meta-study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089854v4)
in which the existing literature was simply searched for all previous
IFR values.

Thus, the meta-study mainly consists of previous modelling studies as
well as “raw IFR values”, which are much too high compared to the
actual, population-based IFR values from antibody studies. With few
exceptions, the real IFR values are between 0.1% and 0.4%, and when
mucosal and cellular immunity are taken into account, they are
[approximately 0.1%](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/)
or less.

However, the virus has spread much faster than anticipated, thus causing
a temporarilly high death rate in some places, especially if nursing
homes and hospitals got affected.

**Non-infectious virus fragments**: The U.S. CDC [points out
that](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html)
in most Covid patients, infectious virus particles are no longer
detectable ten to fifteen days after the first symptoms. However,
non-infectious virus fragments (RNA) can still be found *up to three
months* after the first symptoms. This is likely to be a significant
problem with regard to PCR tests, as many people who have long since
ceased to be infectious still test positive, triggering far-reaching
tracing and quarantine false-alarms.

**Deaths with or by or without coronavirus**: In England and some other
countries it [has been reported
that](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/why-no-one-can-ever-recover-from-covid-19-in-england-a-statistical-anomaly/)
all deceased persons who tested positive for the new coronavirus since
the beginning of the year were counted as Covid deaths – regardless of
the time of the test, a possible recovery, and the actual cause of
death. In the US state of Colorado, it was found that [about 10% of
deaths](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data/case-data) were *with* but
*not from* coronavirus. In other US states, further cases of “corona
deaths” became known that in reality were test-positive[homicide
victims](https://cbs12.com/news/local/i-team-deaths-incorrectly-attributed-to-covid-19-in-palm-beach-county)
and [motorcycle
accidents](https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-questions-raised-after-fatal-motorcycle-crash-listed-as-covid-19-death).

##### **Children and schools**

It has been known since March that the risk of disease and transmission
in children is minimal in the case of Covid19. The main reason for this
is probably a pre-existing immunity due to frequent contact with
previous coronaviruses (i.e. cold viruses). There was and is therefore
no medical reason for the closure of primary schools, kindergartens and
day-care centres and for special protective measures in schools.

In the meantime, further studies on this issue have been published:

  - The British epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse stated that
    there is [not a single confirmed
    case](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-known-case-of-teacher-catching-coronavirus-from-pupils-says-scientist-3zk5g2x6z)
    of infection of a teacher by a pupil worldwide.
  - Tracing pioneer Iceland found “[not a single
    case](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/blog/hunting-down-covid-19/)
    where a child under 10 infected their parents.”
  - A joint report from Sweden (without primary school closure) and
    Finland (with primary school closure) concluded that there was [no
    difference](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-schools-idUSKCN24G2IS)
    in infection rates among children in the two countries.
  - In the USA, three times more children up to 14 years of age [have
    died of
    influenza](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/if-covid-fatalities-were-90-2-lower-how-would-you-feel-about-schools-reopening/)
    than of Covid-19 (101 versus 31) since the beginning of the year,
    according to the CDC.
  - A Canadian study found that most of the children with
    “Kawasaki-like” inflammatory symptoms [had no corona
    infection](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-new-syndrome-in-children-thought-to-be-linked-to-covid-19-yields/)
    at all. The disease in children is “very, very rare”, the
    researchers said.
  - A German study came to the conclusion that children act
    epidemiologically [“like brake
    blocks”](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/corona-studie-an-schulen-kinder-eher-bremskloetze-der-infektion-16858827.html)
    and slow down the spread of the new corona virus.

##### **Critical expert opinions**

  - The German virologist **Hendrik Streeck** advocates [a pragmatic
    approach](https://www.merkur.de/welt/coronavirus-zweite-welle-impfstoff-streeck-virologe-warnung-drosten-massentest-infektion-zr-13834907.html)
    to the new coronavirus and targeted measures for people at high
    risk. According to Streeck, the long-term suppression of the virus
    and the hope for a possible vaccine are not sensible strategies.
  - Professor **Carl Heneghan**, Director of the Oxford Centre for
    Evidence-Based Medicine, [explains in an
    interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3plSbCbkSA) that there
    is still no evidence for the effectiveness of masks in the general
    population. A permanent suppression strategy like the one in New
    Zealand is not sensible and causes high damage in the long term. The
    lethality (IFR) of Covid-19 is about 0.1% to 0.3% and is thus
    comparable to previous flu epidemics and pandemics.
  - The Swedish chief epidemiologist **Anders Tegnell** [explains in an
    interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh9wso6bEAc) that
    eradication of the virus is not an option. In Sweden, the infections
    slowed down considerably even without a lockdown, and daily deaths
    now are close to zero. The evidence for the benefit of masks is
    still “very weak” and they might even be counterproductive. An
    introduction at this point in time would make no sense. The
    lethality of Covid-19 is between 0.1% and 0.5% and does not
    “radically differ” from influenza.
  - The epidemiologist and systems biologist Professor **Francois
    Balloux**, Director of the British UCL Genetics Institute, [explains
    in an
    article](https://twitter.com/BallouxFrancois/status/1284513419454971905)
    that Covid-19 is comparable to a pandemic (but not seasonal)
    influenza. The main difference is the age-risk distribution: while
    Covid-19 is mainly dangerous for older people, a pandemic influenza
    is also life-threatening for younger people and children. Professor
    Balloux points out that the “Russian influenza pandemic” of 1889 may
    have been triggered by the coronavirus OC-43, which is now
    considered one of the four typical cold viruses.
  - The Swiss chief physician for infectiology, Dr. **Pietro Vernazza**,
    pleads for a [“controlled natural
    immunization”](https://corona-transition.org/der-infektiologe-prof-pietro-vernazza-sieht-covid-19-im-bereich-einer)
    of society as an alternative to the “eradication strategy”. In most
    cases, Covid-19 is mild and the actual mortality rate is about 0.1%,
    which is in the range of a severe influenza. The Swedes “did nothing
    wrong” with their strategy, according to Vernazza.
  - The former director of the Institute of Immunology at the University
    of Bern, Professor **Beda Stadler**, also pleads for a [controlled
    spread of the virus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBRcK-od50Q).
    The danger of the virus had been overestimated due to the false
    assumption of a lack of immunity. Professor Stadler is critical of
    compulsory masks and mass tests. Stadler, who is now emeritus,
    explains that many younger immunologists no longer dare to speak out
    publicly on the subject due to the extreme polarisation of the
    debate by politics and the media.

On the other hand, **Professor Karin Mölling**, the former head of the
Department of Virology at the University of Zurich and one of the
earliest critical voices on corona measures, has now [partly changed her
opinion](https://www.bazonline.ch/eine-zweite-welle-laesst-sich-vermeiden-zumindest-bis-im-winter-959708338566):
Due to the sometimes serious lung damage, the virus should not be
underestimated and containment measures are important.

##### **The clinical picture of Covid-19**

The lower-than-expected lethality of Covid-19 should not hide the fact
that the new coronavirus, due to its efficient use of the human ACE2
cell receptor, in some cases can lead to [severe
disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0968-3) with
complications in the lung, the vascular and nervous systems and other
organs, some of which can [persist for
months](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351).

While it is true that most of these symptoms can also occur in severe
influenza (including
[thrombosis](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091014111549.htm)
the temporary loss of the [sense of
smell](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948436/)), they are indeed more
frequent and more pronounced in the novel Covid-19 disease.

In addition, even apparently “mild” disease (without hospitalization)
can in some cases lead to protracted complications with breathing
problems, fatigue or other symptoms. The US CDC [came to the
conclusion](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm) that
after one month, about one third of the “mild” cases still showed such
symptoms. Even in the 18 to 34-year-olds without preconditions, about
20% still had after-effects.

On the positive side, researchers at a German clinic recently reported
[good chances of
recovery](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/kontraste/coronavirus-langzeitfolgen-101.html):
“We can see that the lungs can heal well, even in patients who have had
three weeks of intensive care”. After three months, 20% of the intensive
care patients had healthy lungs again, and in the remaining patients a
clear regeneration was visible.

Nevertheless, the primary goal should be to avoid a progression of the
disease.

##### **On the treatment of Covid-19**

**Note**: Patients are asked to consult a doctor.

Many countries adopted the strategy of imposing a lockdown during or
after a wave of infection, thereby locking already infected high-risk
individuals in their homes without treatment until they developed severe
breathing problems and needed intensive care treatment immediately. Even
today, test-positive high-risk persons are often simply quarantined
without treatment.

This is not an ideal approach. Numerous studies and doctors’ reports
have now shown that for people at high risk or with high exposure,
*early treatment* immediately on onset of the first typical symptoms is
crucial to avoid disease progression and hospitalization.

Studies and medical reports from various countries in Asia and the West
recommend a [combination
protocol](https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/) of zinc
(which inhibits the RNA replication of coronaviruses), the antimalarial
agent HCQ (which promotes the cellular uptake of zinc and has other
anti-viral properties), and, if necessary, an antibiotic (to prevent
bacterial superinfections) and a blood thinner (to prevent thrombosis
and lung embolism).

Yale professor and physician Harvey A. Risch argues [in a recent
commentary](https://www.newsweek.com/key-defeating-covid-19-already-exists-we-need-start-using-it-opinion-1519535)
that early treatment with HCQ and zinc as well as an antibiotic has
proven to be “highly effective”. In the USA alone, according to
Professor Risch, 70,000 to 100,000 deaths [could have been
prevented](https://www.foxnews.com/media/hydroxychloroquine-could-save-lives-ingraham-yale-professor)
by the systematic use of HCQ. Risch is therefore calling for an
immediate and prescription-free release of this medication, as is
already the case in many other countries.

Meanwhile, a bizarre battle has broken out in western industrialised
countries over the use of low-cost HCQ, which has been used
[successfully and safely for
decades](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/hcq-white-paper-dr-simone-gold.pdf)
in the prevention and treatment of malaria and several other diseases.
This battle appears to be driven in part by political and commercial
interests and may produce a great many casualties.

Opponents of HCQ went as far as publishing falsified studies and using
lethal doses during trials, [as Dr. James Todaro
explains](https://www.medicineuncensored.com/a-study-out-of-thin-air),
who uncovered one of these frauds that fooled top science journals, the
WHO and health experts worldwide.

Many of these anti-HCQ activities [are connected
to](https://omnij.org/Gilead:_Twenty-one_billion_reasons_to_discredit_hydroxychloroquine_\(ORIGINAL_ARTICLE\))
pharmaceutical company Gilead, which wants to sell a drug that is over a
hundred times more expensive (Remdesivir), but which is only used on
intensive care patients and has some [severe side
effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305282).

In addition, a potentially effective early treatment stands in the way
of the billion-dollar global vaccination strategy being pursued by
numerous governments, pharmaceutical companies and vaccine investor Bill
Gates. Directors of vaccine companies have already made [about one
billion
dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/business/coronavirus-vaccine-profits-vaxart.html)
with stock and option gains alone, even without yet delivering a
vaccine.

The hope for a safe and effective vaccine, however, still seems
questionable: Contrary to the positive media presentation, in the second
test round of the RNA vaccine from the US company Moderna, [80% of the
volunteers](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/vaccines/letter-to-wv-legislators-the-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-is-likely-to-make-more-people-sick-than-covid-19/)
(average age 33 years and healthy) in the medium and high-dose groups
reacted with moderate to severe side effects.

Covid-19](https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/)

##### **The effectiveness of face masks**

Various countries are discussing or have already introduced mandatory
face masks in the general population. In the updates of June and July,
however, it was shown that the evidence for the effectiveness of cloth
masks in the general population is [still rather
weak](https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/), contrary to what is
reported in many media.

In previous influenza pandemics, cloth masks [had no
influence](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article) on
the occurrence of infection. Despite masks, Japan had its last flu
epidemic with [more than five million
diseased](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/)
just one year ago, in January and February 2019. Even the outbreak of
the Covid pandemic in Wuhan could not be stopped by the widespread use
of masks there.

Due to the significantly lower hospitalisation and mortality rates of
Covid-19 (compared to the original assumptions), masks are not
necessarily required to “flatten the curve”. Masking only makes sense –
if at all – in the context of a vaccination strategy that aims to
suppress the virus until a vaccine is available.

BBC medical correspondent Deborah Cohen explained in mid-July that the
partial update of the WHO recommendation on masks was due not to new
evidence but [“political
lobbying”](https://twitter.com/ClarkeMicah/status/1282987860090593280):
“We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the
evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political
lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.”

The “political lobbying” is likely referring to the group [“Masks for
All”](https://masks4all.co/about-us/), which was founded by a “Young
Leader” of the Davos forum and which is lobbying authorities and
governments for a worldwide face mask obligation.

In connection with masks, the question also arises as to whether the new
coronavirus can be transmitted over large areas by **aerosols**.
According to experts, true aerosol transmission even outdoors [still
seems
unlikely](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768396) –
otherwise the spread of the virus would have a different dynamic and,
contrary to reality, would often be untraceable.

However, an aerosol-like transmission indoors – especially with closed
air circulation by fans or during intensive activities such as singing
and dancing – seems increasingly probable or certain due to various
incidents.

In the case of aerosol transmission, however, cloth masks are likely to
offer even less protection than against droplets due to their pore size
and inaccurate fit. This was demonstrated, for example, by the corona
outbreak at the [German meat processor
Toennies](https://swprs.org/tonnies-corona-ausbruch-trotz-maskenpflicht/),
which occurred at an air-conditioned workplace over a distance of up to
eight metres despite the requirement to wear masks.

On the question of **“asymptomatic transmission”**, it can currently be
said that *true asymptomatic transmission* still [seems to be
rare](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200609/who-clairifies-comments-on-asymptomatic-covid-spread)
according to the WHO (which may explain the very low transmission rate
in children), whereas *pre-symptomatic transmission* in the days before
the first symptoms appear (with already high virus load) is very likely
and may explain the rapid spread of the virus.

Pre-symptomatic transmission is also known [from
influenza](https://virologydownunder.com/influenza-virus-transmission-with-or-without-symptoms-youre-dropping-flu-virus/),
but the incubation period of influenza is much shorter, so this may be
somewhat less relevant.

The following **expert reviews and articles** critically examine the
effectiveness of cloth masks in the general population:

    They were
    useless.](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/everyone-wore-masks-during-the-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/)

The Swedish chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell recently [stated
that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-28/sweden-unveils-promising-covid-19-data-as-new-cases-plunge)
the introduction of masks at this point in time, and even in public
transport, would be “pointless” in view of the rapidly decreasing number
of cases in Sweden. The Dutch government [has stated
that](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-netherlands-idUSKCN24U2UJ)
it will not in general recommend masks because the scientific evidence
for their effectiveness is weak.

On the other hand, face masks are not harmless, as the following
evidence shows:

  - The WHO warns of various [“side
    effects”](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-\(2019-ncov\)-outbreak)
    such as difficulty breathing and skin rashes.
  - Tests conducted by the University Hospital of Leipzig [have shown
    that](https://science.orf.at/stories/3201213/) face masks
    significantly reduce the resilience and performance of healthy
    persons.
  - A German psychological study with about 1000 participants found
    [“severe psychosocial
    consequences”](https://corona-transition.org/der-maskenzwang-ist-verantwortlich-fur-schwere-psychische-schaden-und-die)
    due to the introduction of mandatory face masks in Germany.
  - The Hamburg Environmental Institute warned against the [inhalation
    of chlorine
    compounds](https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht)
    in polyester masks as well as problems in connection with disposal.
  - The European rapid alert system RAPEX has already [recalled 70 mask
    models](https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht)
    because they did not meet EU quality standards and could lead to
    “serious risks”.
  - In China, two boys who had to wear a mask during sports classes
    [fainted and
    died](https://www.ibtimes.com/2-chinese-boys-wearing-masks-during-gym-class-dropped-dead-reports-say-2971556).
  - In the US, a car driver wearing an N95 (FFP2) mask [fainted and
    died](https://nypost.com/2020/04/24/driver-crashes-car-after-passing-out-from-wearing-n95-mask/)
    in an accident.

**Conclusion**: It is still possible that cloth masks can slow down the
rate of infection in the general population, but the evidence for this
is currently limited and the potential benefits are mainly relevant in
the context of a long-term and still uncertain vaccination strategy.

evidence.](https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/)

##### **Is Covid-19 a pure “test epidemic”? Certainly not.**

Some particularly skeptical observers still seem to perceive Covid
predominantly as a “test epidemic”. However, this position has been
untenable for months already.

The best known “test epidemic” is the so-called swine flu of 2009/2010,
a rather mild influenza virus that only caused worldwide anxiety due to
mass testing and media panic. A commission of the Council of Europe
later called the swine flu a [“fake
pandemic”](https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html#658c006c48e8)
and a “big pharma fraud”.

What was noteworthy at the time was that a few months earlier, the WHO
[changed its pandemic
guidelines](https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html#658c006c48e8)
and removed the criterion of increased lethality. In addition,
pharmaceutical companies [signed secret
contracts](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1242147/The-false-pandemic-Drug-firms-cashed-scare-swine-flu-claims-Euro-health-chief.html)
worth billions with governments for a vaccine that later led to
sometimes serious [neurological
damage](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brain-damaged-uk-victims-swine-flu-vaccine-get-60-million-compensation-1438572)
and had to be disposed of for the most part.

Finally, researchers discovered that the swine flu virus itself probably
[originated from vaccine
research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1743-422X-6-207) and
was released through a leak (or worse).

On the other hand, due to its special characteristics – in particular
the very efficient use of the ACE2 cell receptor – the new coronavirus
is a dangerous and easily transmissible SARS virus which can cause
severe damage to the lungs, blood vessels and other organs. The good
fortune is that many people already have a certain immunity to the new
virus or at least are able to neutralize it on the mucosal membrane.

Covid-19 is therefore a real and serious pandemic and comparable to the
([still
stronger](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/covid-19-comparison-e1592927192181.png))
flu pandemics of 1957/58 (Asian flu) and 1968 to 1970 (Hong Kong flu).
The comparison with the swine flu of 2009 is only possible because the
deaths caused by swine flu were [greatly
exaggerated](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/swine-flu-cases-overestimated/).

(On the other hand, it should be remembered that during the 1968/1970
flu pandemic – or rather in the summer between the two main waves – the
famous [Woodstock festival was
held](https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/)
and social life mostly went on as usual).

However, it can be argued that the real Covid19 pandemic has been
amplified by a “test pandemic” due to the mass testing in the general
population, causing additional panic and very high costs.

Stanford Professor Scott Atlas [argued already in
May](https://www.facebook.com/cnn/posts/10160799274796509) that mass
testing in the general population is of little use and that testing
should instead be limited to vulnerable institutions such as nursing
homes and hospitals (including for visitors).

Daily mass testing is also not effective because, [according to antibody
studies](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/), the virus is
already much more widespread than PCR tests show, anyway. Moreover, the
tests are susceptible to false-positive (and false-negative) results and
non-infectious virus fragments.

Countries such as Japan, Sweden and Belarus have shown that the pandemic
can be controlled without a lockdown and without mass testing – and in
the case of Sweden and Belarus also without masks – as long as the
sensitive facilities are protected.

**Conclusion**: Covid-19 is a real and serious pandemic comparable to
the (still stronger) influenza pandemics of 1957 and 1968, but in
addition to the real Covid-19 pandemic, there is indeed a “test
pandemic” which causes additional panic and high costs.

pandemic](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/global-cases-deaths.png?w=600&h=434)

##### **The origin of the new coronavirus**

The origin of the new SARS coronavirus remains unclear. However,
researchers with access to Chinese documents [were able to show in
May](https://swprs.org/covid-19-virus-origin-the-mojiang-miners-passage-hypothesis/)
that the closest related coronavirus was found in a mine in southwest
China, where six miners contracted Covid-like pneumonia in 2012 and
three of them died.

The miners’ illness was clinically virtually identical to today’s
(severe) Covid-19, which is why some analysts have proposed to call the
disease[Covid-12](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23covid12&f=live)
instead of Covid-19.

The Virological Institute in Wuhan received virus samples from the mine
as well as from the tissue of the deceased miners in 2012 and 2013. It
is conceivable that this virus escaped from the laboratory in autumn
2019.

In addition to the Chinese institute, however, the US health authority
CDC and the US Department of Defense [have also been
shown](https://armswatch.com/project-g-2101-pentagon-biolab-discovered-mers-and-sars-like-coronaviruses-in-bats/)
to be working with SARS-like viruses from bats. The US NGO “Eco Health
Alliance” cooperated on this issue with both the US Pentagon and the
Virological Institute in Wuhan.

Direct transmission by an animal is also still conceivable, although
previous candidates such as the well-known animal market in Wuhan or the
Pangolin theory [have been ruled
out](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200708/Research-sheds-doubt-on-the-Pangolin-link-to-SARS-CoV-2.aspx)
by experts in the meantime.

Hypothesis](https://swprs.org/covid-19-virus-origin-the-mojiang-miners-passage-hypothesis/)

##### **B. Countries and regions**

##### **USA**

The USA is one of the countries most affected by the new coronavirus so
far. This could have political and medical reasons.

Medically, there are many relevant pre-existing conditions in the US
population, such as obesity, heart problems and diabetes. Air
conditioning systems could promote aerosol-like transmission indoors.
Politically, there have been serious mistakes in dealing with nursing
homes, misplaced incentives in the treatment of patients, and
problematic back-and-forth with lockdowns.

  - The US already has over 150,000 corona deaths, putting it in the
    range of a pandemic influenza, comparable to the [1957 and 1968
    pandemics](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest/).
  - 45% of corona deaths occurred [in nursing
    homes](https://freopp.org/the-covid-19-nursing-home-crisis-by-the-numbers-3a47433c3f70).
    Over 50% of all deaths occurred [in the six
    states](https://twitter.com/pdubdev/status/1280195926238261248/photo/1)
    that actively placed Covid patients in nursing homes.
  - For people of school and work age (up to 65), corona mortality is
    comparable to mortality [from other pneumonia
    diseases](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/if-covid-fatalities-were-90-2-lower-how-would-you-feel-about-schools-reopening/)
    (e.g. influenza), according to the CDC. For children and
    adolescents, Covid is three times less dangerous than influenza.
  - A [nationwide antibody
    study](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/largest-seroprevalence-study-in-us-shows-vast-covid-19-undercount-67762)
    showed that the new coronavirus is 6 to 24 times more widespread
    than assumed on the basis of PCR tests, depending on the region.
    However, the antibody levels are still in the single-digit
    percentage range in most regions, indicating that exposure to the
    coronavirus is less much less than 50% in many places.
  - While the number of daily positive tests reached a peak in mid-July
    due to the high number of tests, the [number of daily
    deaths](https://covidusa.net/) was only half as high as in April,
    although recently with a slight upward trend again (see graph
    below).
  - In Florida there were reports of at times allegedly very high
    positivity rates. However, an [analysis showed
    that](https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-florida-department-of-health-says-some-labs-have-not-reported-negative-covid-19-results)
    various laboratories only reported the number of positive tests and
    thus an apparent positivity rate of 100%. The actual positivity rate
    in Florida was mostly in the single-digit percentage range. In terms
    of deaths per capita, Florida remains in the lower midfield compared
    to the other states.
  - The median age of Covid deaths in the USA [is 78.5
    years](https://twitter.com/kylamb8/status/1287952340822175744). This
    is higher than the median age of “other deaths”, but lower than the
    median age of Covid deaths in Europe (80 to 86).
  - Yale professor and epidemiologist Harvey A. Risch [recently called
    for](https://www.newsweek.com/key-defeating-covid-19-already-exists-we-need-start-using-it-opinion-1519535)
    immediate over-the-counter availability of HCQ for the early
    treatment of Covid disease.
  - A group of doctors calling itself “America’s Frontline Doctors” held
    a press conference with the same goal. The [video of the press
    conference](https://omnij.org/AmericasFrontlineDoctors) was seen by
    20 million people within a day before it was deleted by Facebook &
    Co. as
“disinformation”.

##### **Great Britain**

  - In England and Wales there have been about 50,000 corona deaths so
    far. The overall mortality rate is thus still [about 10,000 deaths
    below](http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/) the strong flu epidemic of
    1999/2000.
  - There has been [no excess
    mortality](http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/) among those under 45
    years of age compared to the last five years.
  - The cumulative corona deaths since March [correspond almost
    exactly](http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/) to the cumulative
    influenza and pneumonia deaths since the start of the winter season
    in December 2019.
  - Since mid-June, England and Wales have been [in relative
    under-mortality](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending17july2020)
    and daily corona deaths have been below daily influenza and
    pneumonia deaths since then.
  - By mid-April, [45% of NHS nursing
    staff](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12182503/nearly-half-nhs-workers-infected-coronavirus-peak-epidemic/)
    had already been infected with corona. A significant proportion of
    patients may have been infected with corona in hospital. Corona
    patients were also transferred to nursing homes in England, which
    led to additional deaths.

![England: Deaths in 2020 versus 2000
([InProportion](http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/))](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/england-wales-2020-1999-comparison.png?w=736&h=393)

##### **France**

France was relatively hard hit by the corona pandemic and registered
[about 30,000 corona
deaths](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-et-traumatismes/maladies-et-infections-respiratoires/infection-a-coronavirus/documents/rapport-synthese/surveillance-de-la-mortalite-au-cours-de-l-epidemie-de-covid-19-du-2-mars-au-31-mai-2020-en-france)
by the end of May according to the health authority SPF. About 50% of
these deaths occurred in nursing homes, the average age of the deaths is
81.3 years. The median age of [intensive care
patients](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/download/260891/2645733)
was about 67 years.

The region around Paris, eastern France and northern France were
particularly hard hit, while large parts of western France and
southwestern France were hardly affected at all (so far).

So although only part of France was affected by Covid, the cumulative
excess mortality since the beginning of the year (compared to the
baseline) is about 50% higher than during the seasonal flu waves of the
past five years. In Greater Paris, the excess mortality rate is even
around 500% or 10,000 people higher than in previous years (see graphs
below).

Covid deaths accounted for around 16% of all deaths nationwide, but in
Greater Paris, the figure was almost 40% of all deaths from early March
to late May. The weekly peak mortality due to Covid-19 is comparable to
the record hot summer of 2003 (see graph below).

Didier Raoult, a well-known professor of medicine and HCQ pioneer from
Marseille, criticized the lack of early treatment and the ban on HCQ [at
a parliamentary
hearing](http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/)
at the end of June. Until 2019, HCQ was available in France without
prescription. At the beginning of the pandemic, however, its use was
restricted to clinics and eventually [banned
altogether](https://www.france24.com/en/20200527-france-revokes-decree-authorising-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-to-treat-covid-19).
The reason for the ban was the [falsified Lancet
study](https://omnij.org/Gilead:_Twenty-one_billion_reasons_to_discredit_hydroxychloroquine_\(ORIGINAL_ARTICLE\))
from the end of May (which was later retracted).

In his clinic, Prof. Raoult had been able to reduce the case fatality
rate to a very low 0.9% by early treatment with HCQ, according to a
[published retrospective
analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920302817).

##### **Germany**

Germany counts only about 9000 corona deaths and has not experienced any
significant excess mortality (in population-adjusted terms there was
even a [slight
undermortality](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/breyer-deutschland-untersterblichkeit.pdf)).

At the end of June, however, [only 1.3% of blood
donors](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Projekte_RKI/SeBluCo_Zwischenbericht.html)
had IgG antibodies against the new coronavirus. This value is very low.
Even if non-blood donors (including children and sick persons), T-cells
and mucosal (IgA) immunity are taken into account, exposure of the
population to the virus is hardly more than 10% to 15%.

This means that the new coronavirus has not yet spread widely in
Germany. The measures or – more likely – the anticipation of the
measures by the population therefore seem to have been successful in
this sense (see graph below).

On the other hand, this means that epidemiologically, Germany is
essentially still where it was in April and that the risk of a new and
stronger increase in infections and disease is indeed real. The
comparison with France shows what this can mean.

The German government currently seems to be following a suppression and
vaccination strategy. This strategy is socially and economically costly
and its success remains uncertain. As an alternative or addition, an
[early treatment
concept](https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/) should be
examined.

The political corona situation in Germany remains tense. Repeatedly,
sanctions have been imposed on doctors, professors, lawyers and civil
servants who are critical of corona, and in some cases serious attacks
occurred against skeptical journalists and activists.

Since June, an [extra-parliamentary committee of
inquiry](https://corona-ausschuss.de/) consisting of lawyers and medical
experts has been dealing with the German Corona government policy. It
should not be forgotten, however, that the corona pandemic in Germany is
probably not yet over, given that by the end of June, only 1.3% of blood
donors had IgG antibodies against the virus.

##### **Switzerland**

  - The Swiss **annual excess mortality** is currently close to zero
    (see graph), which is below most flu waves of the last ten years.
    This is due to the mild winter and the very high median age of the
    approximately 1700 corona deaths (84 years). About 50% of the deaths
    occurred in nursing homes. The effect of the lockdown remains
    questionable.
  - In the former **hotspots Ticino and Geneva**, IgG antibody levels in
    May [were
    about 10%](https://infekt.ch/2020/07/sind-es-doch-10x-mehr-covid-19-faelle/),
    about ten times higher than found by daily PCR tests. Taking
    [mucosal and cellular
    immunity](https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/)
    into account, exposure in southern and western Switzerland could
    already be around 50%. In German-speaking Switzerland, however,
    exposure is likely to be lower. The risk of a “second wave” is
    therefore real.
  - In principle, the Swiss government is pursuing a **suppression and
    vaccination strategy**, which it is supplementing with mass testing,
    contact tracing and partial compulsory masking. As an alternative,
    infectiologist Dr. Pietro Vernazza brought up the[idea of controlled
    exposure](https://corona-transition.org/der-infektiologe-prof-pietro-vernazza-sieht-covid-19-im-bereich-einer)
    with protection of risk groups based on the Swedish model.
  - Switzerland still has no [early treatment
    strategy](https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/) and thus
    risks an unnecessarily high hospitalisation and death rate.
  - Sweden and Belarus, both of which managed the corona pandemic
    without a lockdown and without compulsory masks, [have been
    removed](https://www.nau.ch/news/schweiz/42-lander-schweiz-hat-liste-der-corona-risikolander-erweitert-65747991)
    from the Swiss list of **“high-risk countries”** in mid-July. Sweden
    had previously put Switzerland on its own high-risk list. In fact,
    the increase in Swedish “cases” was solely due to an increase in
    tests.
  - A referendum [was
    launched](https://corona-transition.org/referendum-gegen-die-swisscovid-app-gestartet)
    against the corona tracing app **“SwissCovid”**. The initiators are
    raising data protection and security concerns. Previously, Swiss
    Professor Serge Vaudenay published[a critical
    analysis](https://swprs.org/corona-app-ein-eklatanter-betrug/) of
    the app, which isn’t as transparent as claimed, leaving Google and
    Apple in control, Vaudenay said.
  - A referendum [is also being
    prepared](https://notrecht-referendum.ch/) against the Swiss
    **“Covid-19 Law”**, which extends the Corona emergency law until
    the end of 2022. In addition, a petition [has been
    launched](https://fruehling2020.com/) calling for an
    extra-parliamentary commission of inquiry into the corona measures.
  - A [flyer
    campaign](https://www.20min.ch/story/bag-warnt-vor-fake-news-flyer-der-maskengegner-559612676323)
    against the compulsory use of masks in public transport also caused

##### **Sweden  
**

  - In Sweden, **daily corona deaths** are now close to zero. The
    overall mortality rate is in the range of earlier strong flu waves.
    Even the monthly peak mortality (in April 2020) [remained
    below](https://emanuelkarlsten.se/more-swedes-died-in-one-month-1993-and-2000-compared-to-april-2020-why/)
    the strong flu waves of the 1990s.
  - The example of Sweden (and Belarus) shows that a **lockdown** was
    not necessary if the population and institutions were well prepared.
    However, from the perspective of many lockdown advocates –
    governments and the media – this is [very difficult to
    admit](https://emanuelkarlsten.se/multiple-errors-in-the-new-york-times-article-about-swedens-corona-strategy/).
  - Sweden is one of the few Western countries that – on the basis of
    the medical evidence – has not closed its **primary schools**. This
    decision [was
    correct](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-schools-idUSKCN24G2IS),
    too.
  - Sweden made **two real mistakes**, which ironically are not covered
    by most of the media: 1) The nursing homes in the Stockholm area
    were protected too late and caused over 50% of Swedish deaths. 2)
    Sweden had no early treatment strategy that could have reduced the
    hospitalisation and death rates.
  - Swedish cities showed an **IgG antibody prevalence** [between 10%
    and 20%](https://www.sll.se/verksamhet/halsa-och-vard/nyheter-halsa-och-vard/2020/07/20-juli-lagesrapport-om-arbetet-med-det-nya-coronaviruset/)
    in July, which, together with mucosal and cellular immunity,
    indicates that the population was exposed between 50% and 100%.
    Sweden is therefore probably the best placed of all western
    countries to start the coming winter.

The following graphs compare the deaths in Sweden with those in England
and New
York.

##### **India**

India, which relies on early treatment and [even
prophylaxis](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/diagnostics/hcq-beneficial-as-preventive-drug-sms-doctors-told-icmr/76464620)
with the antimalarial drug HCQ, officially counts only [about 35,000
corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India) deaths
among its 1.3 billion people.

An Indian [antibody
study](https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/covid-infected-and-cured-undetected-in-delhi/cid/1787002)
came to the conclusion that around 23% of the 20 million inhabitants of
the Indian capital Delhi already have antibodies against the new corona
virus. This is about 35 times more people than confirmed by PCR tests.

This means that Delhi (and some other major cities) could already be
beyond or near the herd immunity threshold, taking into account mucosal
and cellular immunity.

##### **Latin America**

Brazil has by now suffered 90,000 Covid deaths and thus ranges between
the Netherlands and France in terms of deaths per population. In the
meantime, Brazil has introduced an early treatment concept based on zinc
and HCQ.

Chile and Peru currently have an even higher death rate than Brazil
(based on population). With close to 20,000 deaths, Peru is in the range
of Italy and Spain.

##### **C. Political notes

    in the second quarter, the highest rate since 1947. The second
    highest decline was in 1958 (10%) – in the wake of the Asian flu
    pandemic.
  - In the US, [up to 28 million
    people](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/looming-evictions-may-soon-make-28-million-homeless-expert-says.html)
    might lose their homes due to corona lockdowns and the economic
    downturn, which could trigger a new mortgage crisis.

    in the second quarter compared with the same quarter of the previous
    year – the biggest decline since 1970.
  - According to the UN, the corona lockdowns and the global economic
    depression could plunge [up to 225 million

    the use of the word “coronavirus”. Consequently, there are no
    coronavirus deaths in the country, at least officially. Those who
    wear a mask are arrested by police, *Reporters without Borders*
    said.

#### July 2020

##### **On the development of the pandemic**

In most Western countries, the peak of coronavirus infections was
already reached in March or April and often before the lockdown. The
peak of deaths in most Western countries was in April. Since then,
hospitalizations and deaths have been declining in most Western
countries (see graphs below).

This development also applies to countries without a lockdown, such as
Sweden, Belarus and Japan. Cumulative annual mortality in most western
countries continues to be [in the range
of](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/#overall-mortality)
a mild (e.g. CH, AT, DE) to strong (e.g. USA, UK) influenza season.

After the end of the lockdowns, the number of corona tests in the
low-risk general population has increased strongly in many countries,
for example in connection with people returning to work and school.

This led to a certain increase in positive test results in some
countries or regions, which was portrayed by many media and authorities
as an allegedly dangerous increase in “case numbers” and sometimes led
to new restrictions, even if the rate of positive tests remained very
low.

“Case numbers” are, however, a [misleading
figure](https://swprs.org/corona-media-propaganda/) that cannot be
equated with sick or infected people. A positive test can, for example,
be due to non-infectious virus fragments, an asymptomatic infection, a
repeated test, or a false-positive result.

Moreover, counting alleged “case numbers” is not meaningful simply
because antibody tests and immunological tests [have long
shown](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/) that the new
coronavirus is up to fifty times more widespread than assumed on the
basis of daily PCR tests.

Rather, the decisive figures are the number of sick people,
hospitalisations and deaths. It should be noted, however, that many
hospitals are now back to normal operation and all patients, including
asymptomatic patients, are additionally tested for the coronavirus.
Therefore, what matters is the number of actual Covid patients in
hospitals and ICUs.

In the case of Sweden, for example, the WHO [had to
withdraw](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-28/sweden-s-covid-expert-says-the-world-still-doesn-t-understand)
the classification as a “risk country” after it became clear that the
apparent increase in “cases” was due to an increase in testing. In fact,
hospitalisations and deaths in Sweden [have been
declining](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/sweden-icu-deaths-june-28.png)
since April.

Some countries have already been in a state of [below-average
mortality](https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/#z-scores-by-country)
since May. The reason for this is that the median age of corona deaths
was often higher than the average life expectancy, as [up to 80% of
deaths](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/#care-homes)
occurred in nursing homes.

In countries and regions where the spread of the coronavirus has so far
been greatly reduced, it is nevertheless entirely possible that there
will be a renewed increase in Covid patients. In these cases, early and
effective treatment is important (see below).

Global Covid-19 mortality is currently – despite the significantly older
population nowadays – a whole order of magnitude below the flu pandemics
of 1957 (Asian flu) and 1968 (Hong Kong flu) and [in the range
of](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/covid-19-comparison-e1592927192181.png)
the rather mild “swine flu pandemic” of
2009.

##### The following chart compares the Covid-19 pandemic to earlier pandemics:

![Global Covid mortality compared to earlier pandemics ([DB
Research](https://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=RPS_EN-PROD&rwobj=ReDisplay.Start.class&document=PROD0000000000509478))](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/covid-19-comparison-e1592927192181.png?w=700&h=571)

##### **On the lethality of Covid-19**

Most antibody studies have shown a population-based Infection Fatality
Rate (IFR) [of 0.1%
to 0.3%](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/). The US
health authority CDC published in May a still cautious [“best
estimate”](https://reason.com/2020/05/24/the-cdcs-new-best-estimate-implies-a-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-below-0-3/)
of 0.26% (based on 35% asymptomatic cases).

At the end of May, however, an immunological study by the University of
Zurich was published, which for the first time showed that the usual
antibody tests that measure antibodies in the blood (IgG and IgM) [can
detect at
most](https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/)
**about one fifth** of all coronavirus infections.

The reason for this is that in most people the new coronavirus is
already neutralised by antibodies on the mucous membrane (IgA) or by
cellular immunity (T cells) and no symptoms or only mild symptoms
develop.

This means that the new coronavirus is probably much more widespread
than previously assumed and the lethality per infection is around five
times lower than previously estimated. The real lethality could
therefore be **significantly below 0.1%** and thus in the range of
influenza.

At the same time, the Swiss study may explain why children usually
develop no symptoms  (due to frequent contact with previous corona cold
viruses), and why even hotspots such as New York City found an antibody
prevalence (IgG/IgM) of at most 20% – as this [already corresponds
to](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-could-it-be-burning-out-after-20-of-a-population-is-infected-141584)
herd immunity.

The Swiss study has in the meantime been confirmed by several more
studies:

1.  A Swedish study [showed
    that](https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown)
    people with mild or asymptomatic disease often neutralized the virus
    with T-cells without the need to produce antibodies. Overall, T-cell
    immunity was about twice as common as antibody immunity.
2.  A large Spanish antibody study published in Lancet [showed
    that](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31483-5/fulltext)
    less than 20% of symptomatic people and about 2% of asymptomatic
    people had IgG antibodies.
3.  A German study (preprint)[showed
    that](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-35331/v1) 81% of the
    people who had not yet had contact with the new corona virus already
    had cross-reactive T-cells and thus a certain background immunity
    (due to contact with previous corona cold viruses).
4.  A Chinese study in the journal Nature [showed
    that](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6) in 40% of
    asymptomatic persons and in 12.9% of symptomatic persons no IgG
    antibodies are detectable after the recovery phase.
5.  Another Chinese study with almost 25,000 clinic employees in Wuhan
    [showed
    that](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130252v1)
    at most one fifth of the presumably infected employees had IgG
    antibodies ([press
    article](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3089476/there-may-be-no-immunity-against-covid-19-new-wuhan-study)).
6.  A small French study (preprint) [showed
    that](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.20132449v1)
    six of eight infected family members of Covid patients developed a
    temporary T-cell immunity without antibodies.

**Video interview**: [Swedish Doctor: T-cell immunity and the truth
about Covid-19 in Sweden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQpg62Kflg)

In this context, a US study in the journal Science Translational
Medicine, using various indicators, [concluded
that](https://news.psu.edu/story/623797/2020/06/22/research/initial-covid-19-infection-rate-may-be-80-times-greater-originally)
the lethality of Covid-19 was much lower than originally assumed, but
that its spread in some hotspots was up to 80 times faster than
suspected, which would explain the rapid but short-duration increase in
patients.

A study in the **Austrian ski resort of Ischgl**, one of the first
European “corona hotspots”, found antibodies [in 42% of the
population](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000118306133/42-4-prozent-der-bewohner-ischgls-haben-antikoerper-gegen-sars).
85% of the infections went “unnoticed” (i.e. very mild), about 50% of
the infections went completely without (noticeable) symptoms.

The high antibody value of 42% in Ischgl was due to the fact that Ischgl
also tested for IgA antibodies in the blood (instead of only IgM/IgG).
Additional tests for mucosal IgA and for T-cells would undoubtedly have
shown even higher immunity levels close to herd immunity.

Ischgl saw two Covid-related deaths (both of them men over 80 with
preconditions), resulting in a ‘crude IFR’ of 0.26%. Considering the
population structure and the actual extent of immunity, the
population-based Covid lethality is likely to be below 0.1%

Due to its rather low lethality, Covid-19 falls at most into level 2 of
the five-level [pandemic
plan](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2007/02/hhs-ties-pandemic-mitigation-advice-severity)
developed by US health authorities. For this level, only the
**“voluntary isolation of sick people”** is to be applied, while
further measures such as face masks, school closings, distance rules,
contact tracing, vaccinations and lockdowns of entire societies are not
recommended.

The new immunological results also mean that [“immunity
passports”](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01451-0) and
mass vaccinations are unlikely to work and are therefore not a useful
strategy.

Some media continue to speak of allegedly much higher Covid lethality
levels. However, these media refer to outdated simulation models,
confuse mortality and lethality, or CFR and IFR, or “raw IFR” and
population-based IFR. [More about these errors
here](https://swprs.org/covid19-lethality-how-not-to-do-it/).

In July, an antibody prevalence of allegedly [up
to 70%](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-antibodies.html)
was reported in some New York City districts. However, this is not a
population-based figure, but rather antibodies in people who had visited
an urgent care center.

The following graph shows the actual development of corona deaths in
Sweden (no lockdown, no face mask obligation) compared to the forecasts
of Imperial College London (orange: no measures; grey: moderate
measures). Swedish annual all-cause mortality actually is in the range
of a [medium flu
wave](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/sweden-all-cause-nov-may-1990.jpg)
and 3.6% lower than in previous years.

##### **On the health risks of Covid-19**

Why is the new coronavirus harmless for many people, but very dangerous
for some people? The reason has to to with special features of the virus
and the human immune system.

Many people, including almost all children, can neutralise the new
corona virus with an existing immunity (due to contact with previous
corona cold viruses) or through antibodies on the mucous membranes
(IgA), without it causing much damage.

However, if this does not succeed, the virus can penetrate the organism.
There the virus can cause complications in the lung (pneumonia), the
blood vessels (thromboses, embolisms), and other organs due to its
efficient use of the human ACE2 cell receptor.

If in this case the immune system reacts too weakly (in older people) or
too strongly (in some younger people), the course of the disease [can
become
critical](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nick-cordero-dead-bullets-broadway-waitress-actor-was-41-1301841).

It has also been confirmed that the symptoms or complications of serious
Covid-19 disease can [last for weeks or even
months](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/covid-19-coronavirus-longterm-symptoms-months/612679/)
in some cases.

Therefore, the new coronavirus should not be underestimated and *early*
and effective treatment is absolutely crucial for patients at risk.

In the longer term, the new coronavirus could develop into a typical
cold virus, similar to the [coronavirus
NL63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63), which also
uses the ACE2 cell receptor and nowadays affects primarily young
children and nursing patients, causing upper and lower respiratory tract
infections.

##### **On the treatment of Covid-19**

**Note**: Patients are asked to consult a doctor.

Several studies have now confirmed what some front-line physicians have
been saying since March: Early treatment of Covid patients with zinc and
the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) [is indeed
effective](https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/). US doctors
have reported a reduction in hospitalisation rates [of up
to 84%](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202007.0025/v1) and a
stabilisation of the health condition often [within a few
hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVs_EWVCVPc).

Zinc has antiviral properties, HCQ supports zinc absorption and has
additional antiviral properties. These drugs are supplemented by doctors
if necessary with an antibiotic (to prevent a bacterial superinfection)
and a blood thinner (to prevent infection-related thromboses and
embolisms).

The alleged or actual negative results with HCQ in some studies were
based, according to the current state of knowledge, on [delayed
use](https://c19study.com/) (intensive care patients), [excessive
doses](http://www.francesoir.fr/politique-monde/oxford-recovery-et-solidarity-overdosage-two-clinical-trials-acts-considered)
(up to 2400mg per day), manipulated [data
sets](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine),
or ignored
[contraindications](https://www.iss.it/en/rapporti-covid-19/-/asset_publisher/btw1J82wtYzH/content/id/5334891)
(e.g., favism or heart problems).

Sadly, the WHO, many media and some authorities may have caused
[considerable and unnecessary
damage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ) to public health in
recent months through their negative stance, which may have been
politically motivated or influenced by pharmaceutical interests.

French professor of medicine Jaouad Zemmouri, for example, estimates
that Europe [could have
avoided](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/06/306587/moroccan-scientist-moroccos-chloroquine-success-reveals-european-failures/)
up to 78% of Covid deaths by adopting a consistent HCQ treatment
strategy.

HCQ contraindications such as favism or heart problems need to be
considered, but the recent [Ford Medical Center
study](https://www.henryford.com/news/2020/07/hydro-treatment-study)
achieved a reduction in hospital deaths of around 50% even with 56%
African-American patients (who more often have favism).

However, the crucial point in the treatment of high-risk patients is
**early intervention** as soon as the first typical symptoms develop and
even without a PCR test in order to prevent progression of the disease
and avoid intensive care hospitalization.

Most countries did the exact opposite: after the infection wave in
March, they imposed a lockdown, so that infected and frightened people
were locked up in their homes without treatment and often waited until
they developed severe respiratory distress and had to be taken directly
to the intensive care unit, where they were often sedated and intubated
and were likely to die.

It is conceivable that a zinc HCQ combination protocol, which is simple,
safe and inexpensive, could make more complex drugs, vaccinations and
measures largely obsolete.

More recently, a case study from France [showed
that](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305282)
in four of the first five patients treated with the much more expensive
drug Remdesivir from the pharmaceutical company Gilead, treatment had to
be discontinued due to liver issues and kidney failure.

Covid-19](https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/)

##### **On the effectiveness of masks**

Various countries have introduced or are currently discussing the
introduction of mandatory masks in public transport, in shopping malls,
or generally in public.

Some may argue that the discussion has become largely obsolete because
of the lower-than-expected lethality and [hospitalization
rate](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/#hospitalizations)
of Covid-19 and the available treatment options, which have mostly eased
the initial concern of “flattening the curve”.

Nevertheless, the question of the effectiveness of masks can be asked.
In the case of influenza epidemics, the answer [is already
clear](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article) from a
scientific point of view: masks in everyday life have no or very little
effect. If used improperly, they can even increase the risk of
infection.

Ironically, the best and most recent example of this is the
often-mentioned Japan: Despite its ubiquitous masks, Japan experienced
its most recent [strong flu
wave](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/)
– with around five million people falling ill – just one year ago, in
January and February 2019.

However, unlike SARS corona viruses, influenza viruses are transmitted
also by children. Indeed, Japan had to close around ten thousand schools
in 2019 due to acute outbreaks of the flu.

With the SARS 1 virus of 2002 and 2003, there is [some
evidence](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x)
that *medical* masks can provide partial protection against infection.
But SARS-1 spread almost exclusively in hospitals, i.e. in a
professional environment, and hardly to the general public at large.

In contrast, a study from 2015 [showed
that](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577) the cloth masks in
use today are permeable to 97% of viral particles due to their pore size
and can further increase the risk of infection by storing moisture.

Some studies recently argued that everyday masks are nevertheless
effective in the case of the new coronavirus and could at least prevent
the infection of other people. However, these studies suffer from poor
methodology and sometimes show the opposite of what they claim.

Typically, these studies ignore the effect of other simultaneous
measures, the natural development of infection numbers, changes in test
activity, or they compare countries with very different conditions.

An overview:

1.  A German study [claimed
    that](http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf#page=28) the introduction of
    compulsory masks in German cities had led to a decrease in
    infections. But the data does not support this: in some cities there
    was no change, in others a decrease, in others an increase in
    infections (see graph below). The city of Jena, presented as a
    model, simultaneously introduced the [strictest quarantine
    rules](https://www.mdr.de/thueringen/ost-thueringen/jena/corona-jena-seit-einer-woche-keine-neuinfektion-100.html)
    in Germany, but the study did not mention this.
2.  A study in the journal PNAS [claimed
    that](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857) masks had led to a
    decrease in infections in three hotspots (including New York City).
    This did not take into account the natural decrease in infections
    and other measures. The study was so flawed that over 40 scientists
    recommended that the study [be
    withdrawn](https://reason.com/2020/06/22/prominent-researchers-say-a-widely-cited-study-on-wearing-masks-is-badly-flawed/).
3.  A US study [claimed
    that](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818)
    compulsory masks had led to a decrease in infections in 15 states.
    The study did not take into account that the incidence of infection
    was already declining in most states at that time. A comparison with
    other states was not made.
4.  A Canadian study [claimed
    that](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231v3.full.pdf)
    countries with compulsory masks had fewer deaths than countries
    without compulsory masks. But the study compared African, Latin
    American, Asian and Eastern European countries with very different
    infection rates and population structures.
5.  A meta-study in the journal Lancet [claimed
    that](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31142-9/fulltext)
    masks “could” lead to a reduction in the risk of infection, but the
    studies considered mainly hospitals (Sars-1) and the strength of the
    evidence was reported as “low”.

The medical benefit of compulsory masks therefore continues to [remain
questionable](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data).
A comparative study by the University of East Anglia, for instance, came
to the conclusion that compulsory masks had [no measurable
effect](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown)
on the incidence of Covid infections or deaths.

It is also clear that widespread use of face masks couldn’t stop the
initial outbreak in Wuhan.

Sweden showed that even without a lockdown, without mandatory masks and
with one of the lowest [intensive care bed
capacities](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8)
in Europe, hospitals need not be overburdened. In fact, Sweden’s annual
all-cause mortality has remained in the range of [previous flu
seasons](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/sweden-all-cause-nov-may-1990.jpg).

At any rate, authorities shouldn’t suggest to the population that
mandatory masks reduce the risk of infection, for example in public
transport, as there is no evidence of this. Whether with or without
masks, there is an increased risk of infection in densely packed indoor
areas.

Interestingly, the demand for a worldwide obligation to wear masks is
led by a lobby group called
[“masks4all”](https://masks4all.co/about-us/) (masks for all), which
was founded by a “young leader” of the Davos forum.

##### **The role of contact tracing**

Numerous countries have introduced smartphone apps and special units for
“contact tracing”. However, there is no evidence that these can make an
epidemiologically relevant contribution.

In the case of tracing pioneer Iceland, the app has [largely
failed](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001541/iceland-rakning-c19-covid-contact-tracing/),
in Norway it [was
stopped](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/norway-to-halt-covid-19-track-and-trace-app-on-data-protection-concerns/ar-BB15uMEM)
for data protection reasons, in India, Argentina, Singapore and other
countries it [became
mandatory](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1001360/india-aarogya-setu-covid-app-mandatory/)
after all, in Israel contact tracing is operated [directly by
the](https://www.jewishpress.com/news/the-courts/state-to-high-court-even-more-shin-bet-involvement-in-fighting-the-coronavirus/2020/04/14/)
secret service.

A WHO study on influenza pandemics in 2019 came to the conclusion that
contact tracing is not useful from an epidemiological point of view and
[“is not recommended in any
circumstances”](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf#page=9).
The typical area of application is rather sexually transmitted diseases
or food poisoning.

Moreover, serious concerns about data protection and civil rights
remain.

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden [warned as early as
March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcQFTzck_c) that governments
could use the corona crisis as an occasion or pretext for expanding
global surveillance and control, thus creating an “architecture of
oppression”.

A whistleblower who had taken part in a training program for contact
tracers in the US [described it
as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUyZWw7qoc) “totalitarian” and a
“danger to society”.

Swiss computer science professor Serge Vaudenay [showed
that](https://lasec.epfl.ch/people/vaudenay/swisscovid.html) the contact
tracing protocols are by no means “decentralized” and “transparent”,
because the actual functionality is implemented through a Google and
Apple interface (GAEN) that is not “open source”.

This interface has now been integrated by Google and Apple into [three
billion mobile
phones](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/apple-google-bring-covid-19-contact-tracing-to-3-billion-people).
According to Prof. Vaudenay, the interface may record and store all
contacts, not just those that are medically “relevant”. A German IT
expert, for his part, described tracing apps as a [“Trojan
horse”](https://www.heise.de/news/Informatiker-Die-Corona-App-ist-wie-ein-trojanisches-Pferd-4764560.html).

For more information on “contact tracing”, see the June update.

##### **On the origin of the new coronavirus**

In the June update it was shown that renowned virologists consider a
laboratory origin of the new coronavirus to be [“at least as
plausible”](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/)
as a natural origin. This is due to some genetic peculiarities of the
virus in the receptor binding domain, which lead to high infectivity in
humans.

In the meantime, further evidence for this hypothesis has emerged. More
in these articles:

  - [Covid-19 Virus Origin: The Mojiang Miners Passage
    Hypothesis](https://swprs.org/covid-19-virus-origin-the-mojiang-miners-passage-hypothesis/)
    (SPR)
  - [Seven year coronavirus trail from bat cave via Wuhan
    lab](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/seven-year-covid-trail-revealed-l5vxt7jqp)
    (London Times)

    bats](https://armswatch.com/project-g-2101-pentagon-biolab-discovered-mers-and-sars-like-coronaviruses-in-bats/)
    (DG)

Developments since the beginning of 2020 show that the new coronavirus
cannot be seen as a “bioweapon” in the strict sense of the term, as it
is not deadly enough and not targeted enough. However, it may well cause
fear among the population and be exploited politically.

Nevertheless, besides a potential lab origin, a natural origin continues
to be a realistic possibility, even though the “Wuhan wet market”
[hypothesis](https://thebulletin.org/2020/06/did-the-sars-cov-2-virus-arise-from-a-bat-coronavirus-research-program-in-a-chinese-laboratory-very-possibly)and
more recently the [pangolin
hypothesis](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200708/Research-sheds-doubt-on-the-Pangolin-link-to-SARS-CoV-2.aspx)
have in the meantime been ruled out by experts.

#### June 2020

##### **A. General part**

##### **Studies of Covid-19 lethality  
**

<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">Stanford professor John Ioannidis
published an [<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">overview of Covid-19
antibody
studies</span>](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/)<span style="vertical-align:inherit;"><span style="vertical-align:inherit;">.
According to his analysis, the lethality of Covid19 (IFR) is below 0.16%
in most countries and regions. Ioannidis found an upper limit of 0.40%
for three hotspots.</span></span></span>

In its [latest
report,](https://reason.com/2020/05/24/the-cdcs-new-best-estimate-implies-a-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-below-0-3/)
the US health authority CDC reduced the Covid19 lethality (IFR) to 0.26%
(best estimate). <span style="vertical-align:inherit;">Even this value
may still be seen as an upper limit, since the CDC conservatively
assumes 35% asymptomatic cases, while most studies indicate
[<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">50 to
80%</span>](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1375)<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">
asymptomatic cases.</span></span>

At the end of May, however, Swiss immunologists led by Professor Onur
Boyman published what is probably the [most important
study](https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/)
on Covid19 lethality to date. This preprint study comes to the
conclusion that the usual antibody tests that measure antibodies in the
blood (IgG and IgM) can recognize **at most one fifth** of all Covid19
infections.

The reason for this discrepancy is that in most people the new
coronavirus is already neutralized by antibodies on the mucous membrane
(IgA) or by cellular immunity (T-cells). In most of these cases, no
symptoms or only mild symptoms develop.

<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">This means that the new
coronavirus is probably much more common than previously thought and the
lethality per infection is up to five times lower than previously
assumed. <span style="vertical-align:inherit;">The real lethality could
thus be **<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">well below
0.1%</span>**<span style="vertical-align:inherit;"> and hence in the
range of strong seasonal influenza.</span></span></span>

In fact, several studies have now shown that up to 60% of all people
already have a certain [cellular
immunity](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(20\)30610-3) to
Covid-19, which was acquired through contact with previous coronaviruses
(common cold viruses). Children in particular often come into contact
with such coronaviruses, which could help explain their insensitivity to
Covid19.

The new Swiss study may also explain why antibody studies even in
**hotspots** like New York or Madrid found infection rates of [at most
about 20%](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-results-completed-antibody-testing),
as this would correspond to an actual rate of nearly 100%. In many
regions, the actual prevalence might already be well
[over 50%](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/) and thus in
the range of ​​herd immunity.

Should the Swiss study be confirmed, the assessment of Oxford
epidemiologist Prof. **Sunetra Gupta** would apply**,** who predicted
early on that Covid-19 is very widespread and its lethality
[below 0.1%](https://unherd.com/2020/05/oxford-doubles-down-sunetra-gupta-interview/).

Despite the comparatively low **lethality** of Covid-19 (deaths per
infection), the **mortality** (deaths per population) can still be
increased regionally and in the short term if the virus spreads rapidly
and reaches high risk groups, especially patients in nursing homes, as
indeed happened in several hotspots (see below).

Due to its rather low lethality, Covid-19 falls at most into level 2 of
the five-level [pandemic
plan](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2007/02/hhs-ties-pandemic-mitigation-advice-severity)
developed by US health authorities. For this level, only the
**“voluntary isolation of sick people”** is to be applied, while
further measures such as face masks, school closings, distance rules,
contact tracing, vaccinations and lockdowns of entire societies are not
recommended.

Regarding **contact tracing**, a WHO study on influenza pandemics from
2019 also came to the conclusion that from a medical point of view this
is [“under no circumstances
recommended”](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf),
since it is not expedient for easily communicable and generally mild
respiratory diseases.

It is sometimes argued that the rather low lethality was not known at
the beginning of the pandemic. This is not entirely true, as data from
South Korea, the cruise ships and even from Italy already [showed in
March](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/)
that the risk to the general population is rather low.

Many health authorities also knew this, as [leaked emails from
Denmark](https://www.thelocal.dk/20200529/leaked-emails-show-how-denmarks-pm-steam-rollered-her-own-health-agency)
in mid-March show:
“<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="de"><span title="">The
Danish Health Authority continues to consider that Covid-19 cannot be
described as a generally dangerous disease, as it does not have either a
usually serious course or a high mortality rate.”</span></span>

Some media nevertheless continue to calculate an allegedly much higher
Covid19 lethality rate of sometimes over 1% by simply
[dividing](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-14/antibody-study-shows-just-5-of-spaniards-have-contracted-the-coronavirus.html)
deaths by “infections”, without taking into account the age and risk
distribution, which is absolutely crucial especially for Covid19.

The latest data from the European mortality monitoring
[Euromomo](https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/) shows that several
countries such as France, Italy and Spain are already entering a
**below-average mortality**. The reason for this is that the average age
of Covid19 deaths was very high and fewer people than usual are now
dying in this age group.

**See also**: [Studies on Covid-19
lethality](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/)

![Example: Death rate per age group in Massachusetts, USA (
[source](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-may-6-2020/download)
)](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/death-rate-age-groups-ma.png?w=600&h=339)

##### **The role of nursing homes**

Nursing homes played an [absolute key
role](https://ltccovid.org/2020/04/12/mortality-associated-with-covid-19-outbreaks-in-care-homes-early-international-evidence/)
in the Covid 19 pandemic. In most countries, one to two thirds of all
Covid19 deaths occurred in nursing homes, and [up
to 80%](https://freopp.org/the-covid-19-nursing-home-crisis-by-the-numbers-3a47433c3f70)
in Canada and some US states. Even in Sweden, which did not impose a
lockdown, [75% of
deaths](https://www.thelocal.se/20200525/swedish-death-toll-passes-4000-as-coronavirus-cases-in-care-homes-start-to-fall)
occurred in nursing facilities.

It is all the more worrying that some authorities have *obliged* their
nursing homes to admit Covid patients from the clinics, which has almost
always resulted in numerous new infections and deaths. This happened in
[northern
Italy](https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/the-massacre-of-italy-s-elderly-nursing-home-residents-35575),
England and the heavily affected US states of [New
York](https://nypost.com/2020/05/12/calls-for-independent-probe-of-gov-cuomos-nursing-home-policies/),
New Jersey and
[Pennsylvania](https://nypost.com/2020/05/13/pennsylvania-health-official-moved-mother-from-nursing-home/).

It is also known from northern Italy that the widespread fear of the
virus and the announced lockdown of the country led to the flight of the
predominantly Eastern European nurses, which [further
accelerated](https://swprs.org/covid-19-a-report-from-italy/) the
breakdown of elderly care.

In the United States, [at least 42%
of](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2020/05/26/nursing-homes-assisted-living-facilities-0-6-of-the-u-s-population-43-of-u-s-covid-19-deaths/)
all Covid19 deaths are accounted for by 0.6% of the population living in
nursing homes. Nursing homes require targeted protection and do not
benefit from a general lockdown of society as a whole.

It is well known that even common corona viruses (cold viruses) can be
very dangerous for people in nursing homes. Stanford professor John
Ioannidis pointed out already in mid-March that coronaviruses may have a
case [mortality rate of up
to 8%](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/)
in nursing homes.

In addition, it is often not clear whether these people really died from
Covid-19 or from weeks of stress and total isolation. For example, there
were approximately 30,000 additional deaths in English nursing homes,
but in only 10,000 cases, Covid19 is noted [on the death
certificate](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1931).

In April alone, around [10,000 additional dementia
patients](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/covid-19-causing-10000-dementia-deaths-beyond-infections-research-says)
*without* corona infection died in England and Wales due to weeks of
isolation. Investigations into the situation in nursing homes have been

##### **The role of hospitals**

The second central factor regarding infections and deaths, in addition
to the nursing homes, are the hospitals themselves. A [case study in
Wuhan](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044)
already showed that around 41% of hospitalized Covid patients had in
fact contracted Covid in the hospital itself.

Contagion in hospitals also played a [decisive
role](https://medium.com/%40tepper_jonathan/ground-zero-when-the-cure-is-worse-than-the-disease-3c513d91393d)
in northern Italy, Spain, England and other regions that were severely
affected, meaning that the clinics themselves became the main place of
transmission of Covid19 to already weakened people (so-called nosocomial
infection) – an issue that had already been
[observed](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00523.x)
during the SARS outbreak from 2003.

Based on current knowledge, those countries that managed to avoid
outbreaks of infection in nursing homes and hospitals had comparatively
few deaths. The general lockdown of society, however, played no role or
even a counterproductive role (see below).

An additional factor is the sometimes fatal medical mistreatment of
Covid patients with aggressive drugs or invasive ventilation, the risks
of which experts [have been warning
about](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/06/covid19-are-ventilators-killing-people/)
for months. In the US, for example, there have been questionable
[financial
incentives](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/)
to connect Covid patients to ventilators, a practice that is now [being
investigated](https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/northwell-health-probing-use-of-ventilators-for-covid-patients/)
in several states.

York City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ) (Video)

##### **The clinical picture of Covid-19**

The well-known Hamburg medical examiner Professor Klaus Püschel
presented his [study](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2003)
(English) on the first 12 of 190 detailed corona autopsies at a [press
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXhxorBBPYI) (German).

Professor Püschel again emphasized that Covid-19 “is not nearly as
threatening as was initially suspected”. The danger was “too much
influenced by media images”. The media had focused on severe individual
cases and fueled panic with “completely wrong messages”. Covid-19 is not
a “killer virus” and the call for new medicine or vaccines is “driven by
fear, not facts.”

The specific cause of death of the examined cases was pneumonia, but in
about 50% of the cases there were venous thrombosis in the legs, which
can lead to fatal pulmonary embolism. The kidneys and heart muscle were
also partially affected. Professor Püschel therefore recommends the
preventive administration of blood-thinning medication for serious Covid
cases.

With regard to thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, Professor Püschel –
like other experts before – emphasized that a “lockdown” with quarantine
at home was “exactly the wrong measure”, since the lack of exercise
itself promotes thrombosis. Indeed, US specialists have already been
[warning](https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1258625618431954945)
of this risk after even
*Covid-negative*[people](https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1259548620724080640)
developed
[unexpected](https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1259634922161147910)
thrombosis.

Many media again misinterpreted the autopsy findings and spoke of
Covid-19 as a particularly dangerous disease which, unlike influenza, is
said to lead to thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This is not true,
however: it has been
[known](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874)
for 50 years that even severe influenza can [greatly
increase](https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205\(15\)00284-8/pdf)[the
risk](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091014111549.htm) of
thrombosis and embolism and can affect the [heart
muscle](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/7/3/231/755276)
and other organs. Even the recommendation regarding preventive blood
thinner for severe influenza has been around [for 50
years](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874)already.

##### **Children and schools**

<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span title="">Numerous
studies [have now
shown](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/500349-science-says-open-the-schools)
that children hardly get Covid19 and do not or hardly transmit the
virus, which was [already
known](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642\(20\)30095-X/fulltext)
from the 2003 SARS outbreak. <span title="">There was therefore[no
medical
reason](https://infekt.ch/2020/04/schulen-schliessen-hilfreich-oder-nicht/)
for the closure of schools at any time.</span></span></span>

Accordingly, all those
[countries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-denmark-reopening/opening-schools-in-denmark-did-not-worsen-outbreak-data-shows-idUSKBN2341N7)
that reopened their schools in May saw [no
increase](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/back-school-tracking-covid-cases-schools-reopen)
in cases of infection. Countries like Sweden, which never closed their
primary schools anyway, had no problems with this either.

A preprint study by the German virologist Christian Drosten argued that
the risk of infection from children is comparable to adults and schools
should therefore remain closed. However, several researchers
demonstrated [methodological
errors](https://www.nau.ch/news/europa/coronavirus-forscher-drangen-drosten-zum-ruckzug-der-kinder-studie-65714012)
in the study. Drosten subsequently withdrew the recommendation regarding
school closures.

In some schools, for example in France and Israel, alleged [“corona
outbreaks”
are](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/03/868507524/israel-orders-schools-to-close-when-covid-19-cases-are-discovered)
said to have occurred. However, it is likely that these are
transmissions from teachers to schoolchildren that, to their dismay, are
regularly tested, although they hardly show any symptoms and are
themselves hardly or not at all contagious.

The British *Kawasaki Disease Foundation* again criticized the [dubious
and lurid media coverage
of](https://www.societi.org.uk/kawasaki-disease-and-covid-19/)*Kawasaki
disease*. In fact, there has been no significant increase in Kawasaki
cases and no proven association with Covid-19. General inflammatory
reactions in individual children are also known from other viral
infections, but the number of cases reported so far is extremely low.

German medical associations [have also given the
all-clear](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article208075525/Corona-Kitas-und-Grundschulen-vollstaendig-oeffnen-uneingeschraenkt.html):
Covid-19 is imperceptible or very mild in almost all children. Schools
and daycare centers should therefore be opened immediately and without
restrictions, ie there is no need for small groups, distance rules or
masks.

)](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/school-kids-france.jpg?w=550&h=366)

##### **On the effectiveness of masks**

Regardless of the comparatively low lethality of Covid19 in the general
population (see above), there is still no scientific evidence for the
effectiveness of masks in healthy and asymptomatic people in everyday
life.

<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">A cross-country study by the
University of East Anglia came to the conclusion that a mask requirement
was of [<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">no
benefit</span>](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown)<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">
and could even increase the risk of infection.</span></span>

Two US professors and experts in respiratory and infection protection
from the University of Illinois explain [in an
essay](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data)
that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as
self-protection *nor to protect third parties* (so-called source
control). The widespread use of masks didn’t prevent the outbreak in the
Chinese city of Wuhan, either.

A study from April 2020 in the journal *Annals of Internal Medicine*
[came to the
conclusion](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1342) that
neither fabric masks nor surgical masks can prevent the spread of the
Covid19 virus by coughing.

An article in the *New England Journal of Medicine* from May 2020 also
comes to the conclusion that face masks offer [little or no
protection](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372) in
everyday life. The call for a mask requirement is described as an
“irrational fear reflex”.

A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the U.S. CDC
[also found](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article)
that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment
nor as a source control.

A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open [found
that](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577) cloth masks were
penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by
retaining moisture or reuse of the masks.

The WHO moreover declared in June that truly “asymptomatic transmission”
is in fact [“very
rare”](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/who-says-transmission-by-asymptomatic-covid-patients-very-rare/),
as data from numerous countries showed. Some of the few confirmed cases
were due to [direct body
contact](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1235_article), i.e.
shaking hands or kissing.

In Austria, the face mask requirement in retail and catering will [be
lifted
again](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000117792769/die-maske-wird-wieder-zurueckgedraengt)
from mid-June. A mask requirement was [never
introduced](https://www.thelocal.se/20200514/explained-why-is-sweden-not-recommending-face-masks-to-the-public)
in Sweden because it “does not offer additional protection for the
population”, as the Swedish health authority
explained.

<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span title="">Numerous
politicians, media people and police officers have already [been
caught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2qAKS6Hl4I) putting on their
face masks in a crowd especially for the [television
cameras](https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1265382872631980032) or
taking them off immediately when they [believed
that](https://twitter.com/realPowerTie/status/1261445611594723330) they
were no longer being filmed.</span></span>

In some cases there were [brutal police
attacks](https://twitter.com/DrRJKavanagh/status/1260739779177656325)
because a person allegedly “did not wear her mask properly”.
<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">In other cases, people with a
disability who cannot and do not have to wear a mask, are
[<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">not allowed to
enter</span>](https://bnn.de/lokales/karlsruhe/maskenpflicht-behinderte-sind-befreit-und-werden-dafuer-teils-beschimpft)<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">
department stores
<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">.</span></span></span>

Despite this evidence, a group called
[“masks4all”](https://masks4all.co/about-us/), which was founded by
a “young leader” of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos, is advocating
worldwide mask requirements. Several governments [and the
WHO](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-updates-face-masks-recommendations-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-6)
appear to be responding to this campaign.

Many critics suspect that the masks are more likely to have a
psychological or [political
function](https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/maskenpflicht-gesellschaftliches-klima)(“muzzle”
or “visible sign of obedience”) and that wearing them frequently might
even lead to additional health problems.

A study from Germany empirically showed that the introduction of face
masks [had no effect](http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf#page=28) on
infection rates (see graph). Only the city of Jena appeared to
experience a strong decrease in infections, but Jena simultaneously
introduced [very
strict](https://www.mdr.de/thueringen/ost-thueringen/jena/corona-jena-seit-einer-woche-keine-neuinfektion-100.html)
quarantine regulations.

![Introduction of face masks in German cities had no impact on
infections

##### **On the origin of the virus**

In mid-March, some researchers argued in a letter to the journal Nature
Medicine that the Covid19 virus must be of [natural
origin](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9) and not “from
a laboratory”. They cited the structure of the virus and the fact that
the binding to the human ACE2 cell receptor did not correspond to the
theoretical maximum.

In the meantime, however, numerous [renowned
virologists](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/)
have
[contradicted](https://gmwatch.org/en/news/latest-news/19412-lab-escape-theory-of-sars-cov-2-origin-gaining-scientific-support)this
argument. An artificial origin in the context of virological [functional
research](https://medium.com/%40yurideigin/lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748)
is “at least as plausible” as a natural origin. In fact, coronaviruses
of this kind have been intensively
[researched](https://gmwatch.org/en/news/latest-news/19410-chinese-and-us-scientists-genetically-engineered-bat-coronaviruses-in-dangerous-gain-of-function-research-stretching-back-years)
in several laboratories for almost 20 years (i.e. since the SARS
outbreak in 2003), they say.

Arguments *in favour* of an artificial origin include in particular that
the binding to the human ACE2 cell receptor is [significantly
stronger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06199) than in all common source
animals and that no direct source animal could be identified so far. In
addition, the virus contains some striking functional [gene
sequences](https://gmwatch.org/en/news/latest-news/19403-wuhan-and-us-scientists-used-undetectable-methods-of-genetic-engineering-on-bat-coronaviruses)
that might have been inserted artificially (see graphic below).

The initial theory of the animal market in Wuhan has since been
[rejected](https://thebulletin.org/2020/06/did-the-sars-cov-2-virus-arise-from-a-bat-coronavirus-research-program-in-a-chinese-laboratory-very-possibly)
because none of the animals there tested positive and a third of the
very first patients had no connection to the animal market. The animal
market is now seen as a secondary place of transmission.

It is known that the virological laboratory in Wuhan, in collaboration
with the United States and France,
[researched](https://www.newsweek.com/dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan-lab-millions-us-dollars-risky-coronavirus-research-1500741)
coronaviruses and thereby also generated “potentially pandemic
pathogens” (PPP) that are particularly easy to transmit and / or
particularly dangerous. In addition, there have been several [laboratory
accidents](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-long-history-of-accidental-laboratory-releases-of-potential-pandemic-pathogens/)
with virus releases in China and the USA.

The unbiased observer must therefore continue to consider several
realistic options: a natural origin of the virus (as assumed with SARS
2003), a [laboratory accident](https://project-evidence.github.io/) as
part of functional research (probably in Wuhan), or even a targeted
release by a geopolitically interested actor in the East or West.

Nevertheless, the Covid19 virus is not a “biological weapon” in the
classic sense: the virus is [very easily
transmissible](https://leelabvirus.host/covid19/origins-part2), but not
particularly dangerous for the general population. Animal studies have
shown that much more deadly corona viruses can be generated.

##### **Vaccines against Covid-19**

Various politicians in Europe and the US have declared that the “corona
crisis” can only be ended by a vaccine that is currently being
developed.

However, many experts have [pointed
out](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) that an express
vaccine against the new coronavirus is [not
necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrL9QKGQrWk) or useful due to
the overall [low
lethality](https://www.bitchute.com/video/DXxeej9CW1pz/) (see above) and
the already [declining
spread](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/no-vaccine-for-coronavirus-a-possibility/news-story/34e678ae205b50ea983cc64ab2943608).
The protection of risk groups, especially in nursing homes, could be
much [more
targeted](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-haseltine-newsmake-idUSKBN22W34T).

Some experts like the Swiss infectiologist Dr. Pietro Vernazza also
pointed out that experience shows that the high-risk group in particular
benefits [the
least](https://infekt.ch/2020/05/corona-impfung-als-ultimative-rettung/)
from vaccination, since their immune system no longer reacts adequately
to the vaccine.

Various experts have also [pointed
out](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) the
[significant health
risks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-insight-idUSKBN20Y1GZ)
of an express vaccine. In fact, vaccination against the so-called “swine
flu” from 2009/2010, for example, led to sometimes [severe neurological
damage,](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brain-damaged-uk-victims-swine-flu-vaccine-get-60-million-compensation-1438572)
particularly in children, and to claims for damages in the millions.

Nevertheless, several billion dollars of private and public funds have
already been
[collected](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/europe/eu-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
for the development of a vaccine. An “immunity certificate” for work and
travel is [still being
discussed](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/03/coronavirus-health-passports-for-uk-possible-in-months).
However, contrary to most media reports, the two leading [vaccine
projects](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31252-6/fulltext)
had some serious complications.

In the case of the **Oxford University** vaccine, in animal experiments
[all six rhesus
monkeys](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8331709/Oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-does-not-stop-infection-experts-warn.html)
fell ill with Covid19 despite vaccination and were as infectious as the
unvaccinated monkeys. Nevertheless, the vaccine was moved on to the
human test phase. However, the project manager explained that the
coronavirus had already *become so rare* in the population that the
clinical trial may [deliver no
result](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/23/oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-trial-has-50-per-cent-chance/).

In the case of the novel RNA vaccine from **Moderna**, which was
unusually
[tested](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/researchers-rush-to-start-moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-without-usual-animal-testing/)
directly in human experiments, 20% of the participants in the high-dose
group had a [“serious side
effect”](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/vaccine-trial-catastrophe-moderna-vaccine-has-20-serious-injury-rate-in-high-dose-group/),
although Moderna only allowed very healthy people to try it.

One of the Moderna participants was then presented and interviewed by
CNN as a “hero”. However, it was agreed not to mention that the
participant passed out after the vaccination and became [“as sick as
never before in his
life”](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/modernas-guinea-pig-sickest-in-his-life-after-being-injected-with-experimental-vaccine/).
Several experts also criticized Moderna for [not
disclosing](https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/19/vaccine-experts-say-moderna-didnt-produce-data-critical-to-assessing-covid-19-vaccine/)
their clinical data sufficiently.

<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">The director of the US Corona
Vaccine Rapid Development Program was himself previously a
[<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">director at
Moderna</span>](https://www.businessinsider.com/moncef-slaoui-leading-trump-vaccine-push-10m-holding-moderna-conflict-2020-5)<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">.
President Trump also announced that the vaccine might
<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">be distributed nationwide
[<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">with the U.S.
military</span>](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-says-hes-mobilizing-military-to-distribute-potential-coronavirus-vaccine/ar-BB1463uZ)<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">.
Some countries, such as Denmark, have already created the
[<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">legal
basis</span>](https://www.thelocal.dk/20200313/denmark-passes-far-reaching-emergency-coronavirus-law)<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">
for mandatory vaccination of the entire population. In Germany, too,
[<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">various
politicians</span>](https://www.swp.de/panorama/corona-impfpflicht-wird-die-impfung-bald-zur-vorschrift-in-deutschland_-das-ist-der-momentane-stand-45785279.html)<span style="vertical-align:inherit;">
have <span style="vertical-align:inherit;">spoken out in favor of
compulsory vaccination.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

Proponents of compulsory vaccination, such as World Medical President
Frank Montgomery,
[argue](https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Weltaerztepraesident-fordert-Impfpflicht-article21793158.html)
that the population must be vaccinated to protect those who cannot be
vaccinated for health reasons. In view of the rather [low
lethality](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/) of Covid19
and the already wide prevalence, this argumentation seems rahter
questionable, however. In addition, there are the serious vaccine risks
outlined above.

Nevertheless, the head of the largest European **ticket portal Eventim**
[said](https://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/audio/Ohne-Impfstoff-keine-Konzerte-article21821926.html)
that “major events may not return until there is a vaccine or a
correspondingly effective medication.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who co-chaired the vaccine summit
in early June with US billionaire Bill Gates, described the GAVI vaccine
alliance as a kind of [“health
NATO”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0LAbObZV0). Nevertheless,
“immunity passports” are likely to fail since even antibody tests can
only detect [about 20% of all
infections](https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/),
as the study by Professor Boyman’s group has shown (see above).

##### **Medication against Covid-19**

The situation regarding helpful medication for severe Covid19 cases
remains very unclear. The only consensus is that blood thinners are
[helpful
in](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200506/blood-thinners-could-boost-covid19-survival)
preventing life-threatening thrombosis and embolism (as with severe
influenza).

There have been fierce discussions about the malaria drug
hydroxychloroquin (HCQ) for months. The journal Lancet published a study
at the end of May according to which HCQ leads to heart problems. The
WHO then ceased all of its HCQ studies. Shortly thereafter, however, it
became known that the Lancet study was based on [a manipulated data
set](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine).

The Lancet study and another study in the *New England Journal of
Medicine (NEJM)* had to be
[withdrawn](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/researchers-retract-lancet-study-linking-malaria-drug-to-risks),
which is one of the biggest medical scandals in recent years. The reason
for the manipulated study is not clear, however, the lead author seems
[to be
involved](https://www.medicineuncensored.com/a-study-out-of-thin-air) in
a study of competing drug Remdesivir at the same time.

The use of remdesivir by the pharmaceutical company Gilead came itself
under pressure after [a first study
showed](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/22/health/remdesivir-covid-19-trial-results-nejm-study/index.html)
that the drug could not reduce the risk of death. However, many media
ignored this and still reported positive about the drug.

A former French Minister of Health revealed [in an
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYgiCALEdpE) that the editors
of Lancet and NEJM stated in a confidential discussion panel that the
pressure and influence of pharmaceutical companies had become so great,
indeed “criminal”, that one could no longer speak of science.

Various clinics [use or
study](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200409/chloroquine-zinc-tested-to-block-covid-infection)
HCQ in Covid19 patients, sometimes in combination with zinc, vitamins or
other medications. However, it is known that HCQ can lead to [fatal
complications](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/13/covid19-a-case-for-medical-detectives/)
in people from Africa and the Mediterranean region that have a metabolic
pecularity called favism.

Unfortunately, it must be assumed that incorrect or too aggressive
medication with HCQ,
[steroids](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206110703.htm),
antibiotics and antiviral agents as well as [invasive
ventilation](https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/northwell-health-probing-use-of-ventilators-for-covid-patients/)
has led to numerous additional and avoidable deaths during the corona
pandemic.

##### **Expert opinions (selection)  
**

  - Stanford professor **John Ioannidis** explains [in an interview with
    CNN](https://twitter.com/cnn/status/1256579248342564865) that
    Covid19 is a “widespread and mild disease” comparable to influenza
    (flu) for the general population, while patients in nursing homes
    and hospitals should receive extra protection.
  - Stanford professor **Scott Atlas** explains [in an interview with
    CNN](https://www.facebook.com/cnn/posts/10160799274796509) that “the
    idea of having to stop Covid19 has created a catastrophic health
    care situation”. Professor Atlas says that the disease is “generally
    mild” and that irrational fears had been created, adding that there
    is “absolutely no reason” for extensive testing in the general
    population, which is only necessary in hospitals and nursing homes.
  - The British chief medical officer **Dr. Chris Whitty **[explained in
    a
    lecture](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/15/watch-uk-chief-medic-confirms-again-covid19-harmless-to-vast-majority/)
    that Covid19 posed “no danger to the vast majority of the
    population”. Most people do not or only mildly fall ill with it,
    and even with those who are seriously ill, the chances of recovery
    are good.
  - Stanford professor and Nobel Laureate in Chemistry **Michael
    Levitt** explains [in a new
    article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/23/lockdown-saved-no-lives-may-have-cost-nobel-prize-winner-believes/)
    that the lockdowns did not save lives but cost many. A “panic virus”
    has spread among politicians worldwide, professor Levitt said.
  - Professor **Karel Sikora** of the
    <span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">University
    of Buckingham argued [in an
    interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk2YZfnsOPg) that
    ultimately, fear will “kill a lot more people than the virus,”
    including untreated heart and cancer patients. Schools should be
    opened quickly and masks should remain an individual decision
    because their benefits have not been proven. One should go back to
    an “old normal” and not a “new normal”. (**Note**: The video with
    Professor Sikora was temporarily deleted by YouTube and only
    restored after protests). </span>
  - **Professor Yoram Lass,** former director-general of Israel’s
    Ministry of Health, argues that the lockdown measures have been
    [“totally
    disproportionate”](https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/05/22/nothing-can-justify-this-destruction-of-peoples-lives/)
    and are an acute threat to hundreds of millions of people. Covid19
    is “comparable to a flu epidemic” and would never have justified
    such political destruction of livelihoods. People have been
    intimidated and “brainwashed”.
  - The Oxford professor of epidemiology, **Sunetra Gupta**, argues in a
    [new
    interview](https://unherd.com/2020/05/oxford-doubles-down-sunetra-gupta-interview/)
    that the lethality of Covid19 is likely to be below 0.1% and that a
    large number of people have already come into contact with the
    virus.
  - Leading German virologist **Prof. Hendrik Streeck** criticized the
    lockdown[and explained
    that](https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article209299157/Corona-Krise-Virologe-Streeck-kritisiert-deutschen-Lockdown.html)
    “all experts are returning to the assessment of the early days” that
    Covid-19 “should not be trivialized, but also should not be
    dramatized”. The reason for the declining risk assessment was the
    “enormous number of infections that remained without symptoms”.
    Streeck does not expect any excess mortality in Germany by the end
    of the year, as the average age of death is “rather above life
    expectancy”, and he doesn’t consider “corona apps” and widespread
    corona tests to be useful. He also criticized the general use of
    masks, saying that these are a “wonderful breeding ground for
    bacteria and fungi”. Schools should be reopened as soon as possible.
  - An **employee of the German Ministry of the Interior**, responsible
    for disaster protection, together with external experts wrote a
    [100-page analysis
    paper](https://www.ichbinanderermeinung.de/Dokument93.pdf) on corona
    crisis management, which was leaked to the press at the beginning of
    May and created [strong
    reactions](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2020-05/corona-pandemie-bekaempfung-massnahmen-innenministerium-verschwoerungstheorien-regierungsrat/komplettansicht).
    In the paper, Covid-19 is described as a **“global false alarm”**
    because “there was probably at no time a risk beyond the normal
    level” for the general population. The collateral damage caused by
    the lockdown is now significantly higher than the recognizable
    benefit and far exceeds the risk potential of the corona virus. In
    March and April alone, over a million operations were not carried
    out in Germany. Crisis management and threat analysis mostly failed
    and data supplied by health authorities were “inadequate” as the
    basis for decision-making. The official was subsequently fired
    because he had created the paper “without authorization”.
  - A group led by **Professor Sucharit Bhakdi founded** the Association
    of [Physicians and Scientists for Health, Freedom and
    Democracy](https://www.mwgfd.de/) (MWGFD), which has already been
    joined by over 16,000 supporters. At the beginning of June, the
    group published a [call to the federal government and all state
    governments](https://www.mwgfd.de/category/topaktuell/) to
    immediately and completely lift the Corona measures. Professor
    Bhakdi’s book, [Corona: A False
    Alarm?](https://www.amazon.de/Corona-Fehlalarm-Daten-Fakten-Hintergr%25C3%25BCnde/dp/3990601911),
    appearing at the end of June, is already an Amazon bestseller solely
    due to the pre-orders.
  - A **senior physician for intensive medicine at the University
    Hospital Zurich**, who cared for critical Covid 19 patients,
    criticized in a [widely shared
    video](https://www.medinside.ch/de/post/corona-intensivmediziner-spricht-klartext)
    the “scaremongering” associated with the disease. For the vast
    majority of all people there is no significant risk of death, the
    numbers are comparable overall to earlier flu waves. Risk groups
    could be protected in a targeted manner, while the lockdown only
    prevents the immunization of the general population. In addition,
    people die due to the medical undersupply in other areas. The
    medical and social damage has long been greater than the benefits.
    The partially mandatory mouth protection for schoolchildren also has
    “no medical sense and benefit” and places a heavy burden on the
    children. The “daily counting” of the cases is nonsensical and only
    spreads fear. The counterproductive measures must be stopped
    quickly.Swiss media tried [to put pressure
    on](https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/unispital-distanziert-sich-von-umstrittenen-aussagen-corona-kritiker-feiern-videobotschaft-von-zuercher-oberarzt-id15903859.html)
    the Zurich University Hospital after the video had been widely
    distributed. The doctor has since removed the original video.
  - The Swiss chief physician for infectiology, **Dr. Pietro Vernazza**,
    using current case studies as an example,
    [explains](https://infekt.ch/2020/05/expedition-mit-ueberraschendem-ausgang-ein-epidemiologisches-lehrstueck/)
    that fever measurements and contact tracing are not useful due to
    the often symptom-free course and easy transmission of Covid19.
  - The well-known Swiss immunologist **Dr. Beda Stadler** explains [in
    an
    article](https://www.swissinfo.ch/ita/seconda-ondata-con-lockdown--in-svizzera-no-di-sicuro/45797198)
    that Covid19 is a “very selective disease” and only poses a real
    risk for very few people. The media, on the other hand, focused on
    the few atypical individual cases that exist with every illness.
    Many scientists had focused too much on their models and too little
    on reality. The planned contact tracing is medically “senseless” and
    [spreads](https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/behoerden-und-experten-raetseln-wo-ist-das-virus-hin-id15915001.html)
    “only panic”.

##### **Success stories**

**Sweden**: Sweden had no lockdown, no mask requirement and no primary
school closures, but instead mainly relied on the personal
responsibility and cooperation of the population. This approach [worked
well](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/05/coronavirus-crisis-sweden-refused-lockdown-other-countries-following/)
and Sweden saw only a low mortality rate in the general population,
comparable to a seasonal flu wave.

Nevertheless, the overall mortality rate in Sweden was indeed [higher
than](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/)
in the neighboring Scandinavian countries or in Germany, which was
portrayed by many international media as an alleged “failure of the
Swedish no-lockdown strategy”.

However, most media didn’t mention that [three quarters of Swedish
deaths](https://www.thelocal.se/20200525/swedish-death-toll-passes-4000-as-coronavirus-cases-in-care-homes-start-to-fall)
occured in nursing facilities, which require targeted protection and do
not benefit from a general lockdown of society. Indeed, at 86 years, the
median age of Swedish Covid deaths is likely the highest in the world.

The Swedish government has also been one of the few to apologize for the
insufficient protection of nursing patients and to announce an
investigation, but this has again [been
portrayed](https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/06/08/no-sweden-has-not-changed-its-mind-about-lockdown/)
by many media as an alleged “failure of the Swedish no-lockdown
strategy”.

Yet even total mortality in Sweden remained [below the strongest
seasonal flu
waves](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-toll/coronavirus-pushes-swedish-deaths-to-highest-since-1993-in-april-idUSKBN22U1S4)
of the past thirty years. Moreover, Sweden may now benefit from a very
high [natural
immunity](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-stockholm-virus-antibodies-sweden.html),
especially in view of the latest immunological studies on the actual
range of antibody tests (see above).

![Sweden: All-cause mortality, November to May, since 1990
([SCB/Twitter](https://twitter.com/HaraldofW/status/1270080210545733632))](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/sweden-mortality-comparison-1990-e1591998033581.jpg?w=650&h=399)

**Florida**: Despite being home to many senior citizens, Florida
introduced rather few restrictions and even the popular beaches were
reopened early, which was heavily criticized by many US media.
Nevertheless, Florida [did very
well](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/)
compared to other states and recently had around [2300 deaths in
a](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/03/16/interactive-map-shows-florida-coronavirus-cases-in-real-time/)
population of 21 million, which corresponds to Germany’s low mortality.

In an interview, the governor [explained
that](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/05/coronavirus-crisis-ron-desantis-florida-covid-19-strategy/)
contrary to the media, he realized early on based on the figures from
South Korea and Italy that Covid19 was only dangerous for a very small
risk group and he therefore protected the nursing homes as best as
possible. In terms of prevention, nursing homes were even more important
than the clinics themselves, and this strategy had proven itself. At the
end of May, the governor announced that summer camps and youth
activities could [be carried out without
restrictions](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/florida/articles/2020-05-22/miami-beach-officials-agree-to-reopen-hotels-beaches-june-1).

**Japan**: Japan registered some of the first Covid19 cases outside of
China, but did not introduce a lockdown. At the end of March, the Japan
Times asked, [“Where’s the coronavirus
explosion?”](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/03/20/national/coronavirus-explosion-expected-japan/)
Bloomberg now reports that a corona crisis [never
materialized](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-22/did-japan-just-beat-the-virus-without-lockdowns-or-mass-testing):
there were no restrictions on movement, restaurants and hairdressers
remained open, there were no “tracking apps” and no mass tests of the
general population. Nevertheless – or because of this – Japan now has by
far the least deaths compared to the G7 industrialized countries.

It is sometimes argued that the respirators were decisive for Japan’s
success. However, respirators are voluntary in Japan and did not stop
the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan, while Sweden, Florida and
other successful regions did not use masks in the general population.

**Belarus**: Belarus has probably implemented the least restrictions of
all industrialized nations and [carried
out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZliKGoUN4E) even major events such
as the 75-year celebrations of the end of World War II. Nevertheless,
Belarus officially counts fewer than [300 Covid
deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Belarus) even
after more than three months. Long-term President Lukashenko, who has
repeatedly referred to Corona as a “psychosis,” said in mid-May that the
capital, Minsk, had already
[passed](https://eng.belta.by/president/view/belarus-president-coronavirus-situation-on-the-mend-130571-2020/)
the peak. The decision to treat Covid19 cases like normal pneumonia was
correct. Ultimately, however, only statistics on overall mortality will
be able to show whether the Belarusian numbers are really correct.

##### **Additional Notes**

  - **Transmission routes**: A new report by the US health agency CDC
    comes [to the
    conclusion](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cdc-coronavirus-mainly-spreads-through-persontoperson-contact-and-does-not-spread-easily-on-contaminated-surfaces-153317029.html)
    that the virus is transmitted primarily through direct contact with
    people and “cannot spread easily on surfaces.” The German virologist
    Hendrik Streeck
    [was](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/02/no-proof-coronavirus-can-spread-shopping-says-leading-german/)
    already [able to
    demonstrate](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/02/no-proof-coronavirus-can-spread-shopping-says-leading-german/)
    that the new corona virus does not or hardly spread through objects
    or through aerosols floating in the air.
  - **Distance** **rules**: Iceland [declared
    the](https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2020/05/25/two_meter_rule_optional_in_iceland/)distance
    rules optional at the end of May and reopened bars and clubs.
    Switzerland converted the distance regulations into a voluntary
    [recommendation](https://www.20min.ch/story/bund-schafft-die-2-meter-abstands-busse-heimlich-ab-763738047957).
    A [Cochrane study
    from 2011](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub4/full)
    already showed that there is so far hardly any evidence for the
    effectiveness of “social distancing” measures.
  - **Surgeries**: According to an article in the British Journal of
    Surgery, [around 28 million
    surgeries](https://bjssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bjs.11746),
    including many cancer surgeries, have been canceled or postponed
    worldwide over 12 weeks due to corona measures.
  - **Years of life**: An evaluation by four US professors comes to the
    conclusion that the lockdown in the USA will cost about [twice as
    many years of
    life](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/499394-the-covid-19-shutdown-will-cost-americans-millions-of-years-of-life)
    as Covid-19 and was therefore a very counterproductive measure even
    from a purely medical point of view.
  - **Virus test**: A German mathematician explains why the low
    remaining infection **numbers** in many countries consist largely of
    [false positive
    results](https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/warum-die-pandemie-nicht-endet),
    even with fairly accurate PCR tests, and the pandemic thus “never
    seems to end”.
  - **“Second wave”**: Studies on a “second wave” sometimes make
    [completely unrealistic
    assumptions](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Fellay-Studie-Zweite-Corona-Welle-4726303.html),
    such as a constant risk of infection and death across all age
    groups. Nevertheless, the example of the [1968 Hong Kong
    flu](https://www.britannica.com/event/Hong-Kong-flu-of-1968) shows
    that the global spread of pandemics can indeed extend over several
    seasons.
  - **Italy**: [Almost 5% of the
    population](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098442v2)
    in Milan already had antibodies against Covid19 in mid-February, ie
    before the outbreak of the epidemic in Italy. This again indicates
    that the virus was already circulating in Europe earlier than
    previously thought.
  - **Unemployment**: The International Labor Agency ILO expects that
    due to the political corona measures, half of the world’s employees
    or 1.6 billion people are at [risk of losing their
    livelihoods](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/half-of-worlds-workers-at-immediate-risk-of-losing-livelihood-due-to-coronavirus).

##### **Did the lockdowns save lives?  
**

Many media reported on a study by Imperial College London, according to
which the lockdowns in Europe allegedly [“saved 3 million
lives”](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52968523). In reality,
Imperial College London simply compared the [unrealistic
predictions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/neil-fergusons-imperial-model-could-devastating-software-mistake/)
of its own model with actual developments. This is particularly evident
in the case of Sweden, which even without a lockdown had only a fraction
of the deaths predicted by the Imperial College model (see graph).

![Imperial College model vs. reality in Sweden. **Orange**: prediction
without measures; **grey**: prediction with moderate measures; **blue**:

2020)](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/coronavirus-deaths-in-sweden-actual-deaths-vs-ferguson-projections-may-8-update.png?w=600&h=470)

##### **The role of the media**

Most traditional media, almost all of which are part of [elite
geopolitical
networks](https://swprs.org/the-american-empire-and-its-media/), decided
to run a campaign of fear during the coronavirus period, a behavior that
is usually observed in connection with [wars
of](https://www.infosperber.ch/Artikel/Gesundheit/13-irrefuhrende-und-falsche-Behauptungen-zur-Corona-Epidemie)[aggression](https://swprs.org/the-syria-deception/)
or alleged [terrorist
attacks](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/terror-factory-fbi-trevor-aaronson-book/).

The risk to the general population was greatly
[exaggerated](https://www.infosperber.ch/index.cfm%3Fgo%3DArtikel/Gesundheit/13-irrefuhrende-und-falsche-Behauptungen-zur-Corona-Epidemie/%26g%3Dad),
official policies were [hardly
questioned](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/186723/1/jarren_corona.pdf),
the situation in hospitals was
[dramatized](https://www.globalresearch.ca/truth-behind-refrigerated-morgue-truck-stories/5711475),
manipulative images were
[used](https://nypost.com/2020/04/01/cbs-admits-to-using-footage-from-italy-in-report-about-nyc/),
campaigns were [staged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQWRCECbN-Y),
and protesters were systematically defamed as “idiots”.

It is true that some conservative media criticized the economically
harmful lockdown measures. The real question, however, is whether they
will also criticize the surveillance measures now planned, such as the
extensive societal contact tracing (see below).

Most [independent media](https://swprs.org/media-navigator/) sooner or
later realized that the risk of the corona virus was exaggerated and
politically exploited. Only a few independent media outlets did not
realize this, perhaps because they lacked a medical background or fell
for the official campaign of fear.

Some analysts compared Covid-19 [to a psychological
operation](https://digwithin.net/2020/06/03/coronavirus-scare/) that
uses the media-induced fear of the virus to bring about political and
social change.

US platforms such as Google, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter
[censored](https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/youtube-censors-epidemiologist-knut-wittkowski-for-opposing-lockdown/)
corona issues extensively by deleting critical (i.e. non WHO compliant)
points of view even from doctors or restricting their distribution, a
procedure that has long been the norm for geopolitical issues.

However, modern media users have the option of using manipulation-free
search engines such as DuckDuckGo and independent video platforms such
as Bitchute, as well as generally using an advertising and tracking
blocker on certain media sites.

![A contrarian interview with Prof. Karel Sikora that was temporarily
deleted by Youtube
([Unherd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk2YZfnsOPg))](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/sikora-interview-youtube.jpg?w=600&h=338)

##### **Political developments**

Numerous observers have already drawn attention to the fact that the
predominantly politically induced “corona crisis” is or could be
instrumentalized for far-reaching social and economic changes.

In March, NSA whistleblower **Edward Snowden** warned that governments
are using the temporary corona crisis as an occasion or pretext for the
permanent expansion of [social surveillance and
control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcQFTzck_c), thereby
establishing an “architecture of oppression”.

The measures currently being discussed or already implemented include in
particular:

1.  The introduction of applications for **society-wide** **contact
    tracing**
2.  Building **units to enforce** tracing and isolation of citizens
3.  The introduction of digital **biometric ID cards** that can be used
    to control and regulate participation in social and professional
    activities.
4.  The expanded control of **travel and payment transactions** (e.g.
    cash abolition).
5.  The creation of legal foundations for access to the **biological
    systems** of citizens by governments or corporations (through
    so-called “mandatory vaccinations”).

More than 600 scientists [have warned
of](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/sites/contact-tracing-joint-statement/)
an “unprecedented surveillance of society” through problematic apps for
“contact tracing”. In some countries, such “contact tracing” is
already carried out directly [by the secret
service](https://www.jewishpress.com/news/the-courts/state-to-high-court-even-more-shin-bet-involvement-in-fighting-the-coronavirus/2020/04/14/).
In several parts of the world, the population is already being
[monitored by
drones](https://off-guardian.org/2020/04/25/50-headlines-darker-more-of-the-new-normal/)
and facing serious police overreach.

In May, **Apple and Google added** a contact tracing interface to the
operating systems of [three billion cell
phones](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/apple-google-bring-covid-19-contact-tracing-to-3-billion-people)
that can now be used by national authorities.

This is despite the fact that a recent WHO study on pandemic influenza
came to the conclusion that contact tracing is not sensible from a
medical point of view and is [“not recommended in any
circumstances”](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf),
as the epidemiological benefits of such apps remain doubtful.

It is often argued that the contact tracing applications would remain
“voluntary” and “compliant with data protection”. However, in
practice, neither is really true.

In several countries, the use of the applications is already mandatory
for certain activities. Various employers, administrations, landlords
and transport companies in **India** require [the tracing
app](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1001360/india-aarogya-setu-covid-app-mandatory/).
In **Argentina**, everyone who is in the “public space” must [activate
contact
tracing](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/CuidAR-Argentinien-ueberwacht-mit-einer-App-4720143.html).

Some **German politicians** already advocated a [preference for app
users](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/wer-die-corona-app-hat-soll-zuerst-wieder-ins-restaurant-duerfen-16759932.html)
when traveling or dining out. The **Israeli Prime Minister** Netanyahu,
for his part, spoke of the [use of
“sensors”](https://norberthaering.de/die-regenten-der-welt/netanyahu-sensoren/)
for distance control in children.

In **Singapore**, the “voluntary” app was installed by fewer people than
expected, which is why the government now wants to make it
[mandatory](https://www.letemps.ch/economie/singapour-tracage-app-degenere-surveillance-masse)
for certain public spaces and services. In some parks, the distance
control is already [monitored by DARPA
robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DJmIjKtVkA).

In **Australia**, people who do not want to use the contact tracing app
are insulted by the media [as idiots and a danger to the
public](https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/australia/people-who-refuse-to-download-the-covidsafe-virus-tracing-app-are-the-new-antivaxxers/news-story/541c36fe5cdb56eb1a098b0b9a0dddcc),
and are thus put under social pressure.

The **data protection of** the supposedly “decentralized” contact
tracing is also problematic. The Dutch IT professor Jaap-Henk Hoepmann
[already explained in
April](http://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/11/stop-the-apple-and-google-contact-tracing-platform-or-be-ready-to-ditch-your-smartphone/)
that even supposedly decentralized solutions can very easily be used for
monitoring and surveillance.

Due to the speed of the introduction, the President of the German
Society for Computer Science suspected that the functions [“had long
been in the
devices”](https://www.heise.de/news/Informatiker-Die-Corona-App-ist-wie-ein-trojanisches-Pferd-4764560.html)
and only a little “fine tuning” was required. He sees the apps as a
**“Trojan horse”**.

In parallel to the introduction of the applications, many countries have
started to set up **special units to track contacts and isolate
citizens**.

In the **United States** a [100 billion-dollar
legislation](https://heavy.com/news/2020/05/hr-6666-trace-bill-bobby-rush/)
to set up a national “Corona testing and tracing corps” with up to
[180,000
members](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/29/corona-corps-could-fight-virus-youth-unemployment/)
has been proposed. The states of [New
York](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/johns-hopkins-and-bloomberg-philanthropies-with-new-york-state-launch-online-course-to-train-army-of-contact-tracers-to-slow-spread-of-COVID-19.html)
and
[California](https://timesofsandiego.com/tech/2020/05/06/california-training-a-20000-person-army-of-coronavirus-tracers/)
are already building “contact tracing armies” with up to 20,000 members
each. In the state of
[Washington](https://lynnwoodtimes.com/2020/05/12/governor-inslee-lays-out-statewide-contact-tracing-plan-for-covid-19/),
the National Guard is to participate and those who do not cooperate
“voluntarily” can be forced to do so.

**Italy has** announced the creation of a corps [with 60,000
volunteers](https://www.thelocal.it/20200525/italy-seeks-60000-volunteers-to-enforce-coronavirus-rules),
and
[Switzerland](https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/coronavirus-in-zuerich-contact-tracing-ist-gut-angelaufen-ld.1556846)
and other countries have also started building such units. In
**Germany** there have already been mass tests in residential buildings
under the threat of [police
coercion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZQFpnskP8g).

The **software** for society-wide contact tracing in the USA, [Great
Britain](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/inside-story-cia-backed-palantir-embedded-nhs-socialite-running/)
and possibly in other European countries is provided by the [CIA-related
technology company Palantir
of](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/palantir-coronavirus-cdc-nhs-gotham-foundry/)
US billionaire Peter Thiel. In Israel, contact tracing software from
notorious cyber spy company NSO [is
used](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200402/14261944226/controversial-spyware-vendor-nso-group-is-helping-israeli-government-spy-own-citizens.shtml).

A **whistleblower** who [took
part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUyZWw7qoc) in a training program
for contact tracers in the United States described it in a video
interview as “totalitarian” and a “danger to society”.

All these measures are taken despite the fact that the epidemiological
benefit remains unclear and that the WHO [explicitly
opposed](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf)
contact tracing, which is otherwise used mainly for serious sexual
diseases or food poisoning, which, unlike common respiratory diseases,
are easy to trace.

In addition to applications and special units for contact tracing, there
are also specific [projects or
plans](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/the-uk-government-is-in-talks-with-facial-recognition-firms-to-develop-covid-19-immunity-passports/ar-BB12J6It)
for **“immunity cards”**, which could be used, for example, to control
the travel and work activities of the population. In fact, the EU [had
been](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/22/report-eu-planning-vaccination-passport-since-2018/)
planning to introduce such a vaccination certificate
[since 2018](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/22/report-eu-planning-vaccination-passport-since-2018/).

Such “vaccination cards” are in turn linked to a worldwide
**“vaccination program”**, which is also currently being worked on.
For example, US billionaire and vaccine investor Bill Gates called for
corona vaccination for [“seven billion
people”](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-14-billion-doses-coronavirus-vaccine-may-be-needed-2020-5).
AstraZeneca is currently preparing to produce [two billion doses
of](https://www.sciencealert.com/2-billion-doses-of-oxford-s-potential-coronavirus-vaccine-could-soon-become-available)
the still untested Oxford vaccine.

From a strategic point of view, such a global vaccination programme
would provide access to the biological systems of the population, in
particular the immune and nervous systems and the genetic and
reproductive systems.

In the **economic area**, there is a <span class="s1">surge in
digitization and centralization in favor of a few US technology
corporations, as the *American* <span class="s1">*National Security
Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI)*, led by former Google CEO
Eric Schmidt, [demanded in a strategy
paper](http://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/05/reports/techno-tyranny-how-the-us-national-security-state-is-using-coronavirus-to-fulfill-an-orwellian-vision/)
in 2019 to be able to compete with China.  
</span></span>

The **World Economic Forum (WEF)** Davos, which together with the Gates
Foundation and Johns Hopkins University already ran the well-known
[coronavirus pandemic exercise
“Event 201”](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/scenario.html)
in October 2019, called for a global [“Great
Reset”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5pxhSnDr4U) in order prepare
the economic and social structures for the 21st century.

Meanwhile, several cardinals and bishops of the **Catholic Church**
warned in an [open letter](https://veritasliberabitvos.info/appeal/)
that, under the pretext of the coronavirus, a worldwide panic had been
triggered to introduce “unacceptable forms of global surveillance and
control” of the population.

The idea that a pandemic can be used to expand global monitoring and
control is not new. As early as 2010 the American **Rockefeller
Foundation** described in a [working paper on future technological and
social
developments](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rockefeller-foundation-scenarios-2010.pdf)
a “lockstep scenario” in which the present-day developments were
anticipated with surprising accuracy (from page 18).

But there are also reactions from the population:
[Spain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZo3BYD2qpI),
[Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2Tcs8RzK1k) and
[Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqm456JIaBQ), for example,
have seen demonstrations for fundamental rights with thousands or tens
of thousands of people.

##### **B. Countries and regions**

##### **Scandinavia**

  - **Denmark**: In Denmark, leaked emails revealed that, contrary to
    political statements, the health authority [spoke
    out](https://www.thelocal.dk/20200529/leaked-emails-show-how-denmarks-pm-steam-rollered-her-own-health-agency)[*against*
    a
    lockdown](https://www.thelocal.dk/20200529/leaked-emails-show-how-denmarks-pm-steam-rollered-her-own-health-agency)
    in March and wrote: “
    <span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="de"><span title="">The
    Danish health authority continues to believe that Covid-19 cannot be
    described as a generally dangerous disease because it’s neither
    normally serious, nor does it have a high mortality rate. ” In
    addition, a lower reproduction number was not published for
    political reasons to justify the lockdown. The Danish parliament has
    now decided to investigate government policy by an expert
    commission. </span></span>
  - **Norway**: The Prime Minister of Norway [publicly
    admitted](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/30/coronavirus-norway-wonders-should-have-like-sweden/)
    that she panicked in March and that most of the lockdown measures
    would probably not have been necessary. In Norway, too, it became
    known that the reproduction number already fell to the stable value
    of 1 before the lockdown. In the case of a “second wave”, a much
    softer strategy without lockdown would have to be chosen, the Prime
    Minister declared.
  - **Sweden**: Despite enormous international pressure, Sweden managed
    the Corona period well without a lockdown and overall mortality
    remained in the range of [earlier strong flu
    waves](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-toll/coronavirus-pushes-swedish-deaths-to-highest-since-1993-in-april-idUSKBN22U1S4).
    75% of deaths occurred in nursing homes and nursing apartments, an
    issue the government promised to
    [investigate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-08/sweden-starts-criminal-probe-into-care-home-after-virus-deaths).
    International media tried to portray this as “failure of the Swedish
    no-lockdown strategy”, which of couse is not correct, as nursing
    homes need targeted protection and do not benefit from a general
    lockdown of society.
  - **Schools**: Both Finland and Denmark saw [no
    increase](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/04/no-rise-finlands-coronavirus-infection-rate-since-schools-reopened/)
    in Corona cases after their schools reopened. Sweden kept its
    primary schools open to begin with.

##### **United States  
**

  - There were approximately 100,000 test-positive deaths in the United
    States by the end of May. The **overall mortality rate** since the
    beginning of the year was, however, in the range of the strong flu
    season of 2017/2018 (see chart below).
  - At least [42% of
    deaths](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2020/05/26/nursing-homes-assisted-living-facilities-0-6-of-the-u-s-population-43-of-u-s-covid-19-deaths/)
    occurred in nursing homes, which account for 0.6% of the U.S.
    population and did not benefit from a general lockdown.
  - In the states that **did not implement a lockdown** or removed it
    early, there was [no increased
    mortality,](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8347635/Lockdowns-failed-alter-course-pandemic-JP-Morgan-study-claims.html)
    according to a study by JP Morgan.
  - An evaluation by four US professors comes to the conclusion that the
    lockdown in the US will cost about [twice as many years of
    life](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/499394-the-covid-19-shutdown-will-cost-americans-millions-of-years-of-life)
    as Covid-19.
  - In an [open
    letter](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mass-casualty-incident-over-600-doctors-sign-letter-warning-trump-of-dangers-of-continued-lockdowns),
    over 600 doctors warned US President **Donald Trump of** the dangers
    of an extended lockdown. The lockdown was itself a “mass casualty
    incident”.
  - In another [open
    letter](https://aapsonline.org/physician-letter-reopen-america/) to
    US Vice President **Mike Pence,** American doctors are calling for
    the rapid opening of society. The dangerousness of Covid-19 turned
    out to be much less than originally assumed. The risk groups are
    known and can be protected in a targeted manner. A safe immunization
    of society is also possible without vaccination. The media has
    terrorized the population unnecessarily, triggering a sharp rise in
    despair and suicides.
  - Most of the U.S. Army’s **field hospitals,** which were built for a
    total of $ 660 million,
    [closed](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/07/851712311/u-s-field-hospitals-stand-down-most-without-treating-any-covid-19-patients)
    again in May without treating even a single patient.
  - A California trauma doctor said [in a
    post](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8347011/Doctors-California-say-people-killed-four-weeks-YEAR.html)
    that there were more **suicide attempts** in May than usually in a
    year, and that the suicides far outnumbered the corona deaths in
    California.
  - In the severely affected state of **New York**, an [independent
    investigation was
    requested](https://nypost.com/2020/05/12/calls-for-independent-probe-of-gov-cuomos-nursing-home-policies/)
    regarding the official order for **nursing homes to** admit Corona
    patients. There were over 5000 deaths in New York nursing homes.
    Such orders were also issued in the heavily affected states of New
    Jersey and Pennsylvania.
  - New York’s largest hospital association has announced an
    [investigation into the use
    of](https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/northwell-health-probing-use-of-ventilators-for-covid-patients/)
    invasive **ventilators**. In April, it was confirmed that US
    hospitals [receive large
    bonuses](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/)
    when they admit Covid-19 patients and connect them to ventilators,
    although experts long before [warned
    of](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/06/covid19-are-ventilators-killing-people/)the
    dangers of invasive ventilation. A New York nurse even spoke of a
    [“mass
    murder”](https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/northwell-health-probing-use-of-ventilators-for-covid-patients/).
  - In the state of Washington
    [,](https://www.freedomfoundation.com/washington/washington-health-officials-gunshot-victims-counted-as-covid-19-deaths/)
    the health agency
    [confirmed](https://www.freedomfoundation.com/washington/washington-health-officials-gunshot-victims-counted-as-covid-19-deaths/)
    that even **homicide victims** were counted as “corona deaths” if
    they tested positive for the corona virus. The New York Times also
    listed [a murder victim on
    their](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/24/new-york-times-lists-homicide-victim-coronavirus-d/)
    front page of alleged “Corona victims”. Even **George Floyd**, who
    died during an arrest at the end of May, [tested
    positive](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-george-floyd-20200604-pvhrtjn4mna5blzow3gfx5ag3y-story.html)
    for Corona.
  - By the end of May, [over 40 million
    people](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment-filings-coronavirus-labor-market-layoffs-2020-5)
    had been **unemployed** in the United States. Estimates predict that
    around 42% of lost jobs will [not be
    recovered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/05/15/some-42-of-jobs-lost-in-pandemic-are-gone-for-good/)
    and that the worst recession since World War II is imminent (see
    chart below). Nevertheless, **US billionaires** saw corona add

##### **Great Britain**

  - In March and April, England and Wales experienced an [excess
    mortality](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/analysisofdeathregistrationsnotinvolvingcoronaviruscovid19englandandwales28december2019to1may2020/technicalannex)
    of about 46,000 people. This roughly corresponds to [the strong flu
    waves](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/25/were-all-in-the-big-numbers-now/)
    of 1999 and 2000 (see graphic below). However, the health authority
    ONS notes that almost 30% of this mortality is [not due to the
    coronavirus](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/analysisofdeathregistrationsnotinvolvingcoronaviruscovid19englandandwales28december2019to1may2020/technicalannex).
  - For example, by early May, [8,000 more
    people](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/08/more-people-dying-at-home-during-covid-19-pandemic-uk-analysis)
    died at home than usual, and 80% of these deaths, according to death
    certificates, had nothing to do with the corona virus.
  - In British **nursing homes** alone, there were 30,000 excess deaths
    by the beginning of May, of which only 10,000 cases noted Covid-19
    as the cause on the death certificate, as Cambridge professor David
    Spiegelhalter
    [explained](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1931). In England
    and Wales, around [10,000 additional dementia
    patients](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/covid-19-causing-10000-dementia-deaths-beyond-infections-research-says)
    *without* corona infection died in April due to weeks of isolation.
  - Similar to northern Italy and New York, in England there was a
    [fatal
    decision](https://drmalcolmkendrick.org/2020/05/11/how-to-make-a-crisis-far-far-worse/)
    to move corona patients from hospitals **to nursing homes**, and the
    coronavirus was also spreading rapidly within the healthcare system
    itself.
  - Most of the additional Covid **field hospitals that** were built
    remained [largely
    empty](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/do-many-nhs-nightingale-hospitals-remain-empty/).
  - The influential epidemiologist **Neil Ferguson’s** computer model,
    which predicted hundreds of thousands of deaths, was found to be
    [highly flawed and
    unrealistic](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/neil-fergusons-imperial-model-could-devastating-software-mistake/)
    in an independent analysis by software and modeling experts.
    Ferguson had to resign as a government
    [adviser](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/05/exclusive-government-scientist-neil-ferguson-resigns-breaking/)
    after breaking the lockdown himself to visit his married lover.
    Based on his failed model, his university now claims that the
    lockdown [“saved three million

##### **Switzerland**

Medical aspects:

  - After about four weeks of relative excess mortality, since the
    middle of May Switzerland is already in experiencing [below-average
    mortality](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/schweiz-todesfaelle-2010-2020_woche_22.pdf).
    The cumulative mortality rate since the beginning of the year is in
    the range of a **normal flu season** and far below the strong flu
    season of 2015 (see chart below). Around 50% of deaths occurred in
    [nursing
    homes](https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/coronavirus-zuerich-aendert-nun-das-testregime-in-heimenauch-viele-aeltere-covid-19-infizierte-entwickeln-keine-symptome-zuerich-aendert-nun-das-testregime-in-heimen-ld.1552089)
    that did not benefit from a lockdown. The median age of deaths is
    around 84 years, which is slightly *above* the average Swiss life
    expectancy.
  - There were a total of 130 test-positive deaths in the **Canton of
    Zurich**. More than half of this (78) took place in nursing homes.
    Again slightly more than half of these deaths (40) took place [in
    two nursing
    homes](https://www.republik.ch/2020/05/28/toedlicher-zufall) that
    had to take Covid19 patients from hospitals and were sometimes
    unable to adequately isolate them.
  - ETH Zurich has [repeatedly
    rephrased](https://www.luzernerzeitung.ch/schweiz/die-schweiz-haette-die-kurve-auch-mit-weniger-einschraenkungen-gekriegt-war-der-lockdown-uebertrieben-ld.1221111)
    its study that the decline in the spread of Covid19 began before the
    **lockdown**, in order not to openly contradict to the Federal
    Council. But the result [remains the
    same](https://infekt.ch/2020/04/sind-wir-tatsaechlich-im-blindflug/):
    the lockdown was medically unnecessary and socially
    counterproductive. The forecasts of the authorities and universities
    were based on often completely [unrealistic
    assumptions](https://www.cash.ch/news/politik/coronavirus-schweizer-wissenschaftler-warnen-vor-knappheit-bei-spitalbetten-1511778).
  - Researchers at ETH Lausanne have presented a study warning of the
    risk of a **“second wave”** that could overwhelm Switzerland. The
    main author of the study, Professor Jacques Fellay, is also a member
    of the Federal Council’s Corona Task Force and a supporter of a
    Corona vaccine. An independent analysis of this study, however,
    showed that it is based on [completely unrealistic
    assumptions](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Fellay-Studie-Zweite-Corona-Welle-4726303.html)
    and, for example, predicts a constant risk of infection and death
    for all age groups.
  - Medical entrepreneur Stephan Rietiker from **Inside-Corona** comes
    to [a devastating
    conclusion](https://www.insidecorona.ch/2020/05/21/coronakrise-professionelles-krisenmanagement-sieht-anders-aus/)
    with regard to the Corona management of the Federal Council. The
    Federal Council largely ignored the findings of its own pandemic
    commission and made grotesquely wrong decisions with serious
    consequences for the population and the economy. An unsuitable
    “containment strategy” was pursued in the naive belief that the
    time until a vaccine could be “bridged”. The planned “contact
    tracing” will consume tons of money and ultimately “fail miserably”.
    It is high time to abolish the emergency laws and hold the
    decision-makers accountable, according to Rietiker.

Media:

  - The **Aargauer Zeitung** reported [on the supposedly first
    child](https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/kanton-aargau/erstes-kind-am-coronavirus-gestorben-aargauer-saeugling-zur-behandlung-heimgeflogen-137988950)
    who “died from the coronavirus”. The infant, flown in from Macedonia
    in an emergency, actually died of
    [meningitis](https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/aargau-solothurn/verwirrung-um-todesursache-trauriges-ereignis-aargauer-baby-stirbt-nach-corona-infektion),
    which is not caused by coronaviruses.
  - In May, the **NZZ** once again spread the [false
    report](https://www.nzz.ch/gesellschaft/wie-corona-das-tessin-an-den-rand-einer-katastrophe-brachte-und-die-willensnation-auf-die-probe-stellte-ld.1556749)
    that Corona had brought the southern canton of Ticino “to the brink
    of disaster”. In fact, there were [no serious
    problems](https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/tessin/tessiner-spitaldirektor-widerspricht-dem-bundesamt-fuer-gesundheit-wir-haben-genuegend-intensivbetten-id15808076.html)
    outside of nursing homes in the canton of Ticino.
  - **SRF TV editor-in-chief** Tristan Brenn [defended himself against
    allegations](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/berichterstattung-zu-corona-srf-chefredaktor-nimmt-stellung-zu-fakenews-vorwuerfen)
    that SRF was spreading propaganda about Corona. Shortly afterwards,
    a wheelchair-bound participant in a corona demonstration [pointed
    out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BA83YQT7AE) how SRF had used
    him for propaganda.

Political aspects:

  - In Switzerland there have been weekly **demonstrations for
    fundamental rights** in Bern, Zurich and other cities since April.
    This led to considerable police violence, see [»Corona repression in
    Switzerland«](https://swprs.org/corona-repression-in-der-schweiz/).
    The participants in these demonstrations were mostly defamed by the
    media as dumb or extremist.
  - The Federal Council plans to
    [convert](https://www.zeitpunkt.ch/petition-gegen-umwandlung-der-notverordnungen-dringliches-bundesrecht-lanciert)
    the existing **emergency ordinances** [into urgent federal
    law](https://www.zeitpunkt.ch/petition-gegen-umwandlung-der-notverordnungen-dringliches-bundesrecht-lanciert),
    whereas an online petition has been launched against this step.
  - The Federal Council
    [adopted](https://www.republik.ch/2020/05/21/haftstrafe-ohne-straftat-lauber-soll-abgesetzt-werden-und-bald-nicht-mehr-alles-in-butter)
    a legal basis for the **“corona-tracing app”**, which must be
    approved by Parliament in the summer session. Apple and Google have
    now equipped their mobile operating systems with an appropriate
    interface. The use of the app should remain “voluntary” (see above).
  - The canton of Zurich and several other cantons have already [set
    up](https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/coronavirus-in-zuerich-contact-tracing-ist-gut-angelaufen-ld.1556846)**centers
    for society-wide contact tracing**, consisting of police and health
    department employees who are to contact potentially “infected”
    people and instruct them to be quarantined. The experience of March
    and April had shown that the center would have to be expanded or
    outsourced in the future.
  - A survey by the University of Applied Sciences ZHAW showed that [40%
    of
    Swiss](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/medien/medienmitteilungen/detailansicht-medienmitteilung/event-news/viele-schweizer-fuerchten-ueberwachung-durch-contact-tracing-app/)
    fear a **stronger monitoring** by “Corona apps”. Still, a majority
    plan to use the contact tracing app.
  - In February 2020, US billionaire and vaccine investor Bill Gates
    [donated 900,000 US
    dollars](https://www.christoph-pfluger.ch/2020/05/23/der-groesste-impfstoff-investor-schenkt-der-swissmedic-900000-dollar/)
    to the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products **Swissmedic** for
    “projects in Africa”.
  - Switzerland [will
    support](https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/panorama/schweiz-unterstuetzt-impfallianz-gavi-mit-30-millionen-138082583)
    Bill Gates’ **global vaccine alliance GAVI** with CHF 30 million for
    the development of a coronavirus vaccine.
  - The **Corona-critical doctor from Aargau**, who was brutally
    arrested in April by a special police unit and temporarily admitted
    to the psychiatric center, requested an [external administrative
    investigation](https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/kanton-aargau/polizeieinsatz-wegen-wettinger-arzt-regierung-beschliesst-externe-administrativuntersuchung-137913013)
    into his case, which the government has now initiated. It was
    previously known that, contrary to what the police had said, the
    doctor neither threatened relatives nor the authorities nor was he
    in possession of a loaded weapon.

##### **Germany and Austria**

  - Germany and Austria have **not had any significant excess
    mortality** since March. In fact, Germany has even seen [a slightly
    below-average level of
    mortality](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/breyer-deutschland-untersterblichkeit.pdf)
    since the beginning of the year if corrected for population growth.
  - [Leaked
    protocols](https://www.falter.at/zeitung/20200512/was-passiert-wenn-es-eng-wird)
    in Austria, as in Denmark and England, have shown that the
    **lockdown was politically motivated** and the majority of the
    health experts spoke out against it, recommending to Chancellor Kurz
    in March to get away from the message of a “very dangerous virus”
    because the virus was already widespread and not particularly
    dangerous for the majority of the population.
  - In Germany, [almost a
    million](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article208557665/Wegen-Corona-In-Deutschland-wurden-908-000-OPs-aufgeschoben.html)**surgeries
    were** canceled due to the corona lockdown by the end of May. German
    oncologists [warn of
    delays](https://deutsch.medscape.com/artikelansicht/4908889) in the
    diagnosis and treatment of cancer due to the lockdown. Cancer is a
    “far greater danger than COVID-19,” the medical associations
    emphasized.
  - German **pediatricians** report [massive violence against
    children](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/knochenbrueche-oder-schuetteltraumata-mediziner-berichten-von-massiver-gewalt-gegen-kinder/25833740.html)
    due to the lockdown. They see injuries like those after car
    accidents, including broken bones or shaking trauma. The number of
    calls to the child protection hotline is rising sharply.
  - Berlin medical examiner Professor Michael Tsokos
    [reported](https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/michael-tsokos-berlins-bekanntester-gerichtsmediziner-spricht-von-corona-suiziden-durch-panikmache)
    **“corona suicides”** from people who fear or think they may be
    infected. Professor Tsokos criticized the scaremongering and spread
    of “horror scenarios” by the media and some virologists. He fears
    that the “infectious pandemic” will now be followed by a
    “psycho-social pandemic”. In fact, suicides and suicide attempts
    in Berlin already [“increased
    dramatically”](https://www.tichyseinblick.de/daili-es-sentials/suizide-in-berlin-steigen-im-ersten-quartal-drastisch/)
    in the first quarter.
  - Economic experts in Germany expect [around 10,000
    additional](https://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/konjunktur/insgesamt-fast-30-000-insolvenzen-in-deutschland-experten-geben-erste-schaetzung-ab-corona-treibt-10-000-deutsche-firmen-in-die-pleite_id_12003269.html)
    **bankruptcies by** 2021 due to the political corona measures.
  - Since April some of the largest **fundamental rights demonstrations
    in** Europe have taken place in German cities with up to 25,000
    participants. However, there was sometimes serious police violence,
    for example when arresting vegan celebrity chef [Attila
    Hildmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20HIEEQtyZ8) or
    68-year-old former GDR civil rights activist [Angelika
    Barbe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCbgVFRCnTc). There were also
    [arson
    attacks](https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden-wuerttemberg/spreng-anschlag-100.html)
    and, in some cases, life-threatening
    [attacks](https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden-wuerttemberg/stuttgart/corona-demo-in-stuttgart-ermittlungen-wegen-versuchter-toetung-100.html)
    on demonstrators and independent [media
    people](https://kenfm.de/anschlagsversuch-auf-ken-jebsen-tagesdosis-9-6-2020/)
    by mostly black-hooded groups that apparently are not afraid of
    state persecution.
  - **Werner Winterstein**, the grandson of an Austrian-Jewish Minister
    of Justice murdered by the Nazis, took part in a fundamental rights
    demonstration in Vienna [and declared](https://vimeo.com/418039066)
    that he was “shaken by the silent seizure of power by elements that
    speak of ‘new normality’ on the margins of the democratic model. ”
    The corona-related division of citizens into different categories
    and the creation of a new “snitch culture” are dangerous
    developments. He observed a lack of civil courage and submission to
    the authorities. The planned Corona apps are a move “towards a total
    surveillance state” and should be rejected.

![Weekly mortality in Germany, 2017 to 2020
(Destatis/RKI)](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/sterbefallzahlen-de-25-05.png?w=736&h=414)

##### **South America and Africa  
**

After the spread of corona in Europe and the United States subsided,
many media focused on the situation in South America, especially in
**Brazil**. However, in comparison, the fact is that Brazil with its 210
million inhabitants is still much [better
off](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/)
than many European countries.

In other Latin American countries such as **Ecuador**, in addition to
the coronavirus, [dengue fever
also](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-52383340)
spreads with similar symptoms, which has lead to a double burden on the
health system. Nevertheless, in **Peru** it was found that 80% of
confirmed corona cases [remain
asymptomatic](https://exitosanoticias.pe/v1/covid-19-minsa-el-80-de-casos-confirmados-en-el-peru-son-asintomaticos/).

Some media reported crematoriums running allegedly “around the clock” in
**Mexico City**. A Youtuber living in Mexico [then
visited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQhwEZpDPE) the city and the
hospitals, funeral homes and crematoriums there, all of which had very
little activity.

In general, there has been a [much lower corona mortality
rate](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/coronavirus-why-africa-seems-to-have-few-cases/ar-BB10MNJd)
in countries in South America and Africa than in Europe and the USA,
which may be due to the younger population or climatic factors. On the
other hand, the World Bank expects up to [60 million victims of
poverty](https://www.deccanherald.com/business/economy-business/world-bank-says-covid-19-to-push-60-million-into-poverty-announces-usd-160-billion-assistance-to-100-countries-839661.html)
due to global political corona measures.

##### **C. Global health funding by Bill Gates**

US multi-billionaire and Microsoft founder Bill Gates is the most
important private sponsor of the WHO and the vaccine industry and is
therefore currently in the spotlight. In the following illustrations his
pharmaceutical and media network is graphically represented.
