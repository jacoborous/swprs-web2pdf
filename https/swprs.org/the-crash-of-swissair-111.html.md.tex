\href{https://swprs.org/the-crash-of-swissair-111/}{English}

It is the biggest disaster in Swiss aviation history: On 2 September
1998, near the Canadian Halifax, Swissair Flight 111 from NYC to Geneva
crashed into the Atlantic with 229 people on board. The cause of the
crash has never been clarified. Yet for Swiss media, the case remains
taboo.

In its 2003 investigation report, the Canadian Transportation Safety
Authority (TSB) came to the conclusion that a short circuit in the
entertainment system cabling probably led to a fire in the cockpit,
which caused the plane to crash within minutes.

However, in 2011 a forensic expert from the Canadian Federal Police RCMP
involved in the investigation came to public attention as a
whistleblower and presented new facts that questioned the investigation
report and suggested sabotage or an attack as the cause of the crash.
Six years later, he published his findings and original documents in
book form.

\textbf{The following list summarizes his main statements:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  After only a few days and despite initial indications of a possible
  crime, the investigation management decided to treat the crash
  exclusively as an accident and not to initiate a criminal
  investigation.
\item
  An external metal expert, who was commissioned to investigate the site
  of the fire, found unusually high levels of magnesium residue, which
  indicated that a high-temperature thermite incendiary device had been
  used. However, the expert had to rewrite his report several times at
  the behest of the investigators until all evidence of a possible
  incendiary device was removed. Magnesium was no longer mentioned in
  the investigation report.
\item
  The fire expert of the American FAA aviation authority and other
  experts also suspected the use of an incendiary device due to the
  damage.
\item
  Test experiments, which were intended to prove that the burning
  insulation material alone could melt the aircraft's aluminium frame,
  had to be adjusted on the instructions of the investigators until
  completely unrealistic conditions were reached.
\item
  A piece of molten metal from the aircraft was disposed of during the
  test.
\item
  The recorded voice data did not indicate a failure of the
  entertainment system as would be expected in the event of a short
  circuit. Rather, the examination of the wiring indicated that the
  defects were a result of the fire and not its cause.
\item
  The aircraft maintenance check revealed that a new employee with a
  demonstrably false identity was present during the cleaning and
  handling of the aircraft at New York Airport and did not show up for
  work afterwards.
\item
  According to cargo documents, the plane was supposed to carry diamonds
  with an insurance value of \$300 million, but when the wreckage was
  recovered,
  \href{https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/the-mystery-of-swissair-flight-111-s-diamond-cargo-1.1051965}{they
  were untraceable}.
\item
  In the absence of a criminal investigation, no detailed profiling of
  the passengers was carried out, although
  \href{https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/swissair-crash-may-not-have-been-an-accident-ex-rcmp-1.1019738}{some
  prominent persons} were on board on the flight from New York to
  Geneva.
\item
  During the investigation, the whistleblower was asked by his superiors
  to manipulate his police investigation protocols.
\end{enumerate}

In 2011, Canadian television CBC and Swiss television SRF produced a
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9rVKWsMv_g}{joint documentary
film} in which the whistleblower and the metal expert had their say for
the first time. The SRF journalist in charge also spoke in advance to
two renowned European aviation accident experts, who also criticised the
official investigation report.

Nevertheless, Swiss television surprisingly
\href{http://www.news.ch/SRF+strahlt+Halifax+Doku+nicht+aus/508488/detail.htm}{decided
against} broadcasting the documentary: They did not want to ``spread
speculation'', said the then editor-in-chief. Other Swiss media
\href{https://www.nzz.ch/ein_einzelkaempfer_will_keine_ruhe_geben-1.12534482}{tried
to portray} the Canadian investigator as a ``lone wolf'' or ``conspiracy
theorist''. The then Swissair spokeswoman, however, who had insight into
the whistleblower's extensive documents,
\href{http://www.news.ch/SRF+strahlt+Halifax+Doku+nicht+aus/508488/detail.htm}{was
shocked}: ``What he said was untouchable''.

The reason for the Swiss media's lack of interest, which continues to
this day, is not obvious. The years from 1996 to 1999 were a
\href{https://interaktiv.bernerzeitung.ch/2018/schweizer-privatagenten/}{particularly
difficult time} for Swiss foreign policy. The --
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_massacre}{also unexplained} --
Luxor attack in November 1997 on a mainly Swiss travel group also fell
during this phase.

And three years after Halifax, the attacks of 11 September 2001
occurred, in which,
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_controlled_demolition_conspiracy_theories}{according
to critics} of the official account, thermite could also have been used.
