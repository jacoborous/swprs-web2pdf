An overview of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of face
masks.

#### 1\. Studies on the effectiveness of face masks

So far, most studies found little to no evidence for the effectiveness
of cloth face masks in the general population, neither as personal
protective equipment nor as a source control.

1.  A May 2020 [meta-study on pandemic
    influenza](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article)
    published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither
    as personal protective equipment nor as a source control.
2.  A [July 2020
    review](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/)
    by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medince found that there is
    no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus
    infection or transmission.
3.  <span style="vertical-align:inherit;">A Covid-19 [cross-country
    study](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown)
    by the University of East Anglia came to the conclusion that a mask
    requirement was of <span style="vertical-align:inherit;">no
    benefit</span><span style="vertical-align:inherit;"> and could even
    increase the risk of infection.</span></span>
4.  An [April 2020
    review](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data)
    by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the
    University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in
    everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third
    parties (so-called source control).
5.  An article in the *New England Journal of Medicine* from May 2020
    came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer [little to no
    protection](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372) in
    everyday life.
6.  A [July 2020 study](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13523664) by
    Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection
    against coronavirus” due to their large pore size and generally poor
    fit.
7.  A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open [found
    that](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577) cloth masks were
    penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by
    retaining moisture or repeated use.

##### Additional aspects:

**Japan**, despite its widespread use of face masks, experienced its
[most recent influenza
epidemic](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/)
with more than 5 million people falling ill just one year ago, in
January and February 2019. However, unlike SARS-2, the influenza virus
is transmitted by children, too.

Several countries and states that introduced mandatory face masks on
**public transport and in shops** in early summer, such as
[California](https://covidusa.net/?state=California) and
[Argentinia](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/argentina/),
nevertheless saw a strong increase in infections from July onwards,
indicating a low effectiveness of mask policies.

There is[increasing
evidence](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768396)
that SARS-2 is transmitted, at least indoors, not only by droplets but
also by smaller **aerosols**. However, due to their large pore size,
cloth masks cannot filter out aerosols.

The **WHO** admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 [mask policy
update](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200608/who-changes-stance-says-public-should-wear-masks)
was due not to new evidence but [“political
lobbying”](https://twitter.com/ClarkeMicah/status/1282987860090593280):
“We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the
evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political
lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.” (Deborah Cohen,
BBC Medical Corresponent).

#### 2\. Studies claiming face masks are effective

Some recent studies argued that cloth face masks are indeed effective
against the new coronavirus and could at least prevent the infection of
other people. However, most of these studies suffer from poor
methodology and sometimes show the opposite of what they claim.

Typically, these studies ignore the effect of other measures, the
natural development of infection numbers, changes in test activity, or
they compare countries with very different conditions.

An overview:

1.  A German study [claimed
    that](http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf#page=28) the introduction of
    compulsory masks in German cities had led to a decrease in
    infections. But the data does not support this: in some cities there
    was no change, in others a decrease, in others an increase in
    infections (see graph below). The city of Jena was an ‘exception’
    only because it simultaneously introduced the [strictest quarantine
    rules](https://www.mdr.de/thueringen/ost-thueringen/jena/corona-jena-seit-einer-woche-keine-neuinfektion-100.html)
    in Germany, but the study did not mention this.
2.  A study in the journal PNAS [claimed
    that](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857) masks had led to a
    decrease in infections in three hotspots (including New York City).
    This did not take into account the natural decrease in infections
    and other measures. The study was so flawed that over 40 scientists
    recommended that the study [be
    withdrawn](https://reason.com/2020/06/22/prominent-researchers-say-a-widely-cited-study-on-wearing-masks-is-badly-flawed/).
3.  A US study [claimed
    that](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818)
    mandatory masks had led to a decrease in infections in 15 states.
    The study did not take into account that the incidence of infection
    was already declining in most states at that time. A comparison with
    other states was not made.
4.  A Canadian study [claimed
    that](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231v3.full.pdf)
    countries with mandatory masks had fewer deaths than countries
    without mandatory masks. But the study compared African, Latin
    American, Asian and Eastern European countries with very different
    infection rates and population structures.
5.  A much-cited meta-study in the journal *Lancet* [claimed
    that](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31142-9/fulltext)
    masks “could” lead to a reduction in the risk of infection, but the
    studies considered mainly hospitals (Sars-1), medical (not cloth)
    masks, and the strength of the evidence was reported as “low”.

![Mandatory masks in German cities: no relevant impact.
([IZA 2020](http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf#page=28))](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/germany-face-masks-april-2020.png?w=736&h=547)

#### 3\. Risks associated with face masks

Wearing masks for a prolonged period of time is not harmless, as the
following evidence shows:

1.  The WHO warns of various [“side
    effects”](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-\(2019-ncov\)-outbreak)
    such as difficulty breathing and skin rashes.
2.  Tests conducted by the University Hospital of Leipzig in Germany
    [have shown that](https://science.orf.at/stories/3201213/) face
    masks significantly reduce the resilience and performance of healthy
    persons.
3.  A German psychological study with about 1000 participants found
    [“severe psychosocial
    consequences”](https://corona-transition.org/der-maskenzwang-ist-verantwortlich-fur-schwere-psychische-schaden-und-die)
    due to the introduction of mandatory face masks in Germany.
4.  The Hamburg Environmental Institute warned against the [inhalation
    of chlorine
    compounds](https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht)
    in polyester masks as well as problems in connection with disposal.
5.  The European rapid alert system RAPEX has already [recalled 70 mask
    models](https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht)
    because they did not meet EU quality standards and could lead to
    “serious risks”.
6.  In China, two boys who had to wear a mask during sports classes
    [fainted and
    died](https://www.ibtimes.com/2-chinese-boys-wearing-masks-during-gym-class-dropped-dead-reports-say-2971556).
7.  In the US, a car driver wearing an N95 (FFP2) mask [fainted and
    died](https://nypost.com/2020/04/24/driver-crashes-car-after-passing-out-from-wearing-n95-mask/)
    in an accident.

#### Conclusion

Cloth face masks in the general population might be effective, at least
in some circumstances, but there is currently little to no evidence
supporting this proposition. If the SARS-2 virus is indeed transmitted
via aerosols, at least indoors, cloth masks are unlikely to be
protective.
