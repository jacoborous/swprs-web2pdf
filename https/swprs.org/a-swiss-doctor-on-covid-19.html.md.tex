\paragraph{Overview}\label{overview}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  According to the latest immunological studies, the overall
  \textbf{lethality} of Covid-19 (IFR) is
  \href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{about 0.1\% to
  0.3\%} and thus in the range of a severe influenza (flu).
\item
  For people at high risk or high exposure (including health care
  workers), \href{https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/}{early
  or prophylactic} \textbf{treatment} is essential to prevent
  progression of the disease.
\item
  In countries like the US, the UK, and also Sweden (without a
  lockdown), \textbf{overall mortality} since the beginning of the year
  \href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#overall-mortality}{is
  in the range of} a strong influenza season; in countries like Germany
  and Switzerland, overall mortality so far is in the range of a mild
  influenza season.
\item
  In most places, the \textbf{risk of death} for the general population
  of school and working age is in the range of
  \href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054361v1}{a
  daily car ride to work}. The risk was initially overestimated because
  many people with only mild or no symptoms were not taken into account.
\item
  Up to 80\% of all test-positive persons
  \href{https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1375}{remain symptom-free}.
  Even among 70-79 year olds,
  \href{https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e/9407-covid-dp-fe-01.html}{about
  60\%} remain \textbf{symptom-free}. About 95\% of all people develop
  at most
  \href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#hospitalizations}{moderate
  symptoms}.
\item
  Up to 60\% of all persons
  \href{https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3}{may
  already have} a certain cellular \textbf{background immunity} to the
  new coronavirus due to contact with previous coronaviruses (i.e. cold
  viruses). The initial assumption that there was no immunity against
  the new coronavirus was not correct.
\item
  The \textbf{median age} of the deceased in most countries (including
  Italy) is
  \href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#age}{over 80
  years} (e.g. 86 years in Sweden) and
  \href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-26/italy-says-96-of-virus-fatalities-suffered-from-other-illnesses}{only
  about 4\%} of the deceased had no serious preconditions. The age and
  risk profile of deaths thus essentially corresponds to
  \href{https://www.vienna.at/analyse-zeigt-covid-19-opferkurve-entspricht-normaler-mortalitaet/6581246}{normal
  mortality}.
\item
  In many countries,
  \href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#care-homes}{up
  to two thirds} of all extra deaths occurred in \textbf{nursing homes},
  which do not benefit from a general lockdown. Moreover, in many cases
  it is
  \href{https://www.hsj.co.uk/commissioning/thousands-of-extra-deaths-outside-hospital-not-attributed-to-covid-19/7027459.article}{not
  clear} whether these people really died from Covid-19 or from weeks of
  \href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/covid-19-causing-10000-dementia-deaths-beyond-infections-research-says}{extreme
  stress and isolation}.
\item
  Up to 30\% of all \textbf{additional deaths} may have been caused
  \href{https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/analysisofdeathregistrationsnotinvolvingcoronaviruscovid19englandandwales28december2019to1may2020/technicalannex}{not
  by Covid-19}, but by the effects of the
  \href{https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/two-new-waves-deaths-break-nhs-new-analysis-warns/}{lockdown,
  panic and fear}. For example, the treatment of heart attacks and
  strokes
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/well/live/coronavirus-doctors-hospitals-emergency-care-heart-attack-stroke.html}{decreased}
  by up to 60\% because many patients no longer dared to go to hospital.
\item
  Even in so-called \textbf{``Covid-19 deaths''} it is often
  \href{https://spectator.us/understand-report-figures-covid-deaths/}{not
  clear} whether they died \emph{from} or \emph{with} coronavirus (i.e.
  from underlying diseases) or if they were counted as
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0lIWZpiRU0}{``presumed cases''}
  and not tested at all. However, official figures usually
  \href{https://www.hsj.co.uk/coronavirus/systematic-reviews-to-discover-true-cause-of-outbreak-deaths/7027491.article}{do
  not reflect} this distinction.
\item
  Many media reports of \textbf{young and healthy people} dying from
  Covid-19 turned out to be false: many of these young people either
  \href{https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8193487/Coroner-refuses-rule-COVID-19-cause-death-six-week-old-Connecticut-baby.html}{did
  not die} from Covid-19, they had already been
  \href{https://sports.yahoo.com/spanish-football-coach-francisco-garcia-163153573.html}{seriously
  ill} (e.g. from undiagnosed leukaemia), or they were in fact
  \href{https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Neunjaehrige-Corona-Tote-war-109-Jahre-alt-article21753784.html}{109
  instead of 9} years old. The claimed increase in Kawasaki disease in
  children also turned out
  \href{https://www.societi.org.uk/kawasaki-disease-covid-19/responding-to-press-coverage-28-april-2020/}{to
  be exaggerated}.
\item
  Most \textbf{Covid-19 symptoms} can also be caused by severe influenza
  (including pneumonia,
  \href{https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091014111549.htm}{thrombosis}
  and the temporary loss of the
  \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948436/}{sense of smell}), but
  with severe Covid-19 these symptoms are indeed more frequent and more
  pronounced.
\item
  Strong increases in \textbf{regional mortality} can occur if there is
  a \href{https://swprs.org/covid-19-a-report-from-italy/}{collapse in
  the care of the elderly and sick} as a result of infection or panic,
  or if there are additional risk factors such as
  \href{https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/air-pollution-may-be-key-contributor-to-covid-19-deaths-study}{severe
  air pollution}. Questionable
  \href{https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-safe-handling-of-bodies-or-persons-dying-from-COVID19.pdf}{regulations}
  for dealing with the deceased sometimes led to
  \href{https://www.globalresearch.ca/truth-behind-refrigerated-morgue-truck-stories/5711475}{additional
  bottlenecks} in funeral or cremation services.
\item
  In countries such as Italy and Spain, and to some extent the UK and
  the US, \textbf{hospital overloads} due to strong flu waves
  \href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/04/02/coronavirus-fact-check-1-flu-doesnt-overwhelm-our-hospitals/}{are
  not unusual}. Moreover, this year up to 15\% of health care workers
  were
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/europe/coronavirus-europe-covid-19.html}{put
  into quarantine}, even if they developed no symptoms.
\item
  The often shown exponential curves of \textbf{``corona cases''} are
  \href{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/}{misleading},
  as the number of tests also increased exponentially. In most
  countries, the ratio of positive tests to tests overall (i.e. the
  positivity rate) remained
  \href{https://swprs.org/rate-of-positive-covid19-tests/}{constant at
  5\% to 20\%} or increased only slightly. In many countries, the peak
  of the spread was already reached well
  \href{https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8391141/Did-UKs-coronavirus-crisis-peak-lockdown.html}{before
  the lockdown}.
\item
  Countries \emph{without} \textbf{lockdowns}, such as
  \href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-22/did-japan-just-beat-the-virus-without-lockdowns-or-mass-testing}{Japan},
  \href{https://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-coronavirus-testing-death-rate-2020-3?op=1}{South
  Korea},
  \href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesrodgerseurope/2020/04/04/in-belarus-lukashenko-has-his--own-ways-for-the-country-to-face-coronavirus/}{Belarus}
  and \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfN2JWifLCY}{Sweden}, have
  \href{https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/15/sweden-coronavirus-rates-easing-despite-loose-rule/}{not
  experienced} a more negative course of events than many other
  countries. Sweden was even
  \href{https://nypost.com/2020/04/29/who-lauds-sweden-as-model-for-resisting-coronavirus-lockdown/}{praised}
  by the WHO and now benefits from
  \href{https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown}{higher
  immunity} compared to lockdown countries. 75\% of Swedish deaths
  \href{https://www.thelocal.se/20200525/swedish-death-toll-passes-4000-as-coronavirus-cases-in-care-homes-start-to-fall}{happened
  in} nursing facilities that weren't protected fast enough.
\item
  The fear of a shortage of \textbf{ventilators} was
  \href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/06/covid19-are-ventilators-killing-people/}{unjustified}.
  According to lung specialists, the invasive ventilation (intubation)
  of Covid-19 patients, which is partly done
  \href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/northwell-health-probing-use-of-ventilators-for-covid-patients/}{out
  of fear} of spreading the virus, is in fact often
  \href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/06/covid19-are-ventilators-killing-people/}{counterproductive}
  and damaging to the lungs.
\item
  Various studies
  \href{https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions}{have
  shown that} the main \textbf{routes of transmission} of the virus are
  neither long-range aerosols (i.e. tiny particles \emph{floating} in
  the air)
  \href{https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cdc-coronavirus-mainly-spreads-through-persontoperson-contact-and-does-not-spread-easily-on-contaminated-surfaces-153317029.html}{nor
  smear infections} (i.e. on surfaces), but \emph{direct} contact and
  \emph{droplets} produced when talking or coughing. However, in
  \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768396}{some
  circumstances}, indoor aerosol transmission appears to be possible.
\item
  There is still \href{https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/}{little to
  no scientific evidence} for the effectiveness of \textbf{cloth face
  masks} in \emph{healthy} and \emph{asymptomatic} individuals. Experts
  warn that such masks may interfere with normal breathing and may
  become
  \href{https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-news-face-masks-increase-risk-infection-doctor-jenny-harries-a9396811.html}{``germ
  carriers''} if used repeatedly.
\item
  Many \textbf{clinics} in Europe and the US remained
  \href{https://www.hsj.co.uk/acute-care/nhs-hospitals-have-four-times-more-empty-beds-than-normal/7027392.article}{strongly
  underutilized} or
  \href{https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Stanford-hospital-system-to-cut-pay-20-furlough-15227591.php}{almost
  empty} during lockdowns and in some cases had to
  \href{https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/02/coronavirus-pandemic-jobs-us-health-care-workers-furloughed-laid-off/5102320002/}{send
  staff home}. Millions of surgeries and therapies were
  \href{https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2020/05/covid-disruption-28-million-surgeries-cancelled.aspx}{cancelled},
  including many cancer screenings and organ transplants.
\item
  Several \textbf{media} were caught
  \href{https://nypost.com/2020/04/01/cbs-admits-to-using-footage-from-italy-in-report-about-nyc/}{trying
  to dramatize} the situation in hospitals, sometimes even with
  \href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbs-says-fake-news-wasnt-theirs-11588789238}{manipulative
  images} and videos. In general, the
  \href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eci.13222}{unprofessional
  reporting} of many media maximized fear and panic in the population.
\item
  The \textbf{virus test kits} used internationally are
  \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219885}{prone to errors}
  and can produce false positive and false negative results. Moreover,
  the official virus test was
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_AyuhbnPOI}{not clinically
  validated} due to time pressure and may sometimes react positive to
  other common coronaviruses.
\item
  Numerous
  \href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/03/24/12-experts-questioning-the-coronavirus-panic/}{internationally
  renowned experts} in the fields of virology, immunology and
  epidemiology consider the \textbf{measures} taken to be
  \href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/03/28/10-more-experts-criticising-the-coronavirus-panic/}{counterproductive}
  and recommend rapid
  \href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/04/17/8-more-experts-questioning-the-coronavirus-panic/}{natural
  immunization} of the general population and protection of risk groups.
\item
  At no time was there
  \href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30095-X/fulltext}{a
  medical reason} for the closure of \textbf{schools}, as the risk of
  disease and transmission in children is
  \href{https://thehill.com/opinion/education/500349-science-says-open-the-schools}{extremely
  low}. There is also
  \href{https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article208075525/Corona-Kitas-und-Grundschulen-vollstaendig-oeffnen-uneingeschraenkt.html}{no
  medical reason} for small classes, masks or `social distancing' rules
  in schools.
\item
  Several medical experts
  \href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/31/covid-19-vaccine-amazingly-close-why-am-i-so-worried/}{described}
  express coronavirus \textbf{vaccines} as
  \href{https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/no-vaccine-for-coronavirus-a-possibility/news-story/34e678ae205b50ea983cc64ab2943608}{unnecessary}
  or even
  \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9}{dangerous}.
  Indeed, the vaccine against the
  \href{https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html\#658c006c48e8}{so-called
  swine flu} of 2009, for example, led to cases of
  \href{https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brain-damaged-uk-victims-swine-flu-vaccine-get-60-million-compensation-1438572}{severe
  neurological damage} and lawsuits in the millions. In the testing of
  new coronavirus vaccines, too, serious
  \href{https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/vaccine-trial-catastrophe-moderna-vaccine-has-20-serious-injury-rate-in-high-dose-group/}{complications}
  and
  \href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/05/16/did-the-oxford-covid-vaccine-work-in-monkeys-not-really/}{failures}
  have already been reported.
\item
  A global respiratory disease pandemic can indeed extend over
  \href{https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic}{several
  seasons}, but many studies of a \textbf{``second wave''} are based on
  \href{https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Fellay-Studie-Zweite-Corona-Welle-4726303.html}{very
  unrealistic assumptions}, such as a constant risk of illness and death
  across all age groups.
\item
  In several places, nurses described an oftentimes
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ}{fatal medical
  \textbf{mis­manage­ment}}of Covid patients due to questionable
  \href{https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/}{financial
  incentives} and inappropriate medical protocols.
\item
  The number of people suffering from \textbf{unemployment},
  \href{https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2020/04/03/coronavirus-indiana-how-get-help-mental-health-addiction/5104357002/}{depression}
  and domestic violence as a result of the measures has reached
  \href{https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment-filings-coronavirus-labor-market-layoffs-2020-5}{historic
  record levels}. Several experts predict that the measures will claim
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html}{far
  more lives} than the virus itself. According to the UN
  \href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/half-of-worlds-workers-at-immediate-risk-of-losing-livelihood-due-to-coronavirus}{1.6
  billion people} around the world are at immediate risk of losing their
  livelihood.
\item
  NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden warned that the ``corona crisis'' may
  be used for the
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcQFTzck_c}{permanent
  expansion} of \textbf{global surveillance}. In several parts of the
  world, the population is being
  \href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/04/25/50-headlines-darker-more-of-the-new-normal/}{monitored
  by drones} and facing serious police overreach during lockdowns.
\item
  A 2019 WHO study on measures against pandemic influenza found that
  from a medical perspective, \textbf{``contact tracing''} is
  \href{https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf\#page=9}{``not

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Pre-existing immunity against the
new
coronavirus}}{Pre-existing immunity against the new coronavirus}}\label{pre-existing-immunity-against-the-new-coronavirus}}

At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was assumed that no
immunity against the new coronavirus existed in the population. This was
one of the main reasons behind the initial strategy of ``flattening the
curve'' by introducing stay-at-home orders.

From March and April onwards, however, the first studies showed that a
considerable part of the population already had a
\href{https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3}{certain
immunity} to the new virus, acquired through contact with earlier
coronaviruses (common cold viruses).

Further important studies on this topic were published in July:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \href{https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-35331/v1}{new study
  from Germany} came to the conclusion that up to 81\% of people who
  have not yet had contact with the new coronavirus already have
  cross-reactive \textbf{T-cells} and thus a certain background
  immunity. This confirms earlier studies on T-cell immunity.
\item
  In addition,
  \href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.095414v2}{a
  British study} found that up to 60\% of children and adolescents and
  about 6\% of adults already have cross-reactive \textbf{antibodies}
  against the new coronavirus, which were created by contact with
  previous coronaviruses. This is probably another important aspect in
  explaining the very low rate of disease in children and adolescents.
\item
  In the case of Singapore, a study published in the scientific journal
  Nature
  \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z}{concluded
  that} people who contracted SARS-1 in 2002/2003 still had T-cells that
  were reactive against the new SARS-2 coronavirus 17 years later. In
  addition, the researchers found cross-reactive T-cells, which were
  produced by contact with other, \emph{partly unknown coronaviruses},
  in about half of the people who had neither contracted SARS-1 nor
  SARS-2. The researchers suspect that the different distribution of
  such coronaviruses and T-cells may help explain why some countries are
  less affected than others by the new corona virus, regardless of the
  political and medical measures taken.
\item
  Analysts have previously
  \href{https://twitter.com/boriquagato/status/1280212958392446977}{pointed
  out that} many Pacific countries, and especially China's neighbouring
  countries, have so far had very low Covid death rates, regardless of
  their population structure (young or old) and the measures taken (with
  or without lockdown, mass tests, masks, etc.). A possible explanation
  for this could be the spread of earlier coronaviruses.
\item
  Harvard immunologist Michael Mina explained that the ``drop in
  antibody concentration'' after Covid disease, dramatized by some
  media, was
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html}{``perfectly
  normal''} and ``textbook''. The body ensures long-term immunity
  through T-cells and memory cells in the bone marrow, which can quickly
  produce new antibodies when needed.

\hypertarget{other-medical-updates}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Other medical
updates}}{Other medical updates}}\label{other-medical-updates}}

\textbf{Wuhan}: A Harvard modelling study in the scientific journal
\emph{Nature} came to the conclusion that even in the Covid epicentre
Wuhan, up to 87\% of the infections
\href{https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/study-finds-early-wuhan-covid-cases-largely-undetected/}{went
unnoticed}, i.e. remained without symptoms or mild. This means that the
Covid19 lethality (IFR) in Wuhan may also fall to about 0.1\% or below.
The Nature study confirms an
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v3}{earlier
Japanese study} in the journal \emph{BMC Medicine}, which calculated an
IFR of 0.12\% for Wuhan already back in March.

However, Chinese authorities couldn't yet know this comparatively low
lethality in January and February and therefore built additional clinics
at short notice, many of which eventually remained
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/what-chinas-empty-new-coronavirus-hospitals-say-about-its-secretive-system}{mostly
unused}. Only the systematic test results from South Korea and the
cruise ship Diamond Princess showed that the lethality of the new corona
virus in the general population is indeed lower than initially feared.

\textbf{Italy}: The Italian health authority ISS published
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-study-idUSKCN24H2VZ}{a
new analysis} of the cause of death in about 5000 corona patients.
According to this analysis, Covid was the \emph{direct cause of death}
in 89\% of the cases. In 11\%, other diseases such as heart problems,
cancer or dementia were the primary cause of death. Covid was the
\emph{sole cause of death} in 28\% of cases. It is also known that in
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-26/italy-says-96-of-virus-fatalities-suffered-from-other-illnesses}{about
4\% of the deaths}, no medical preconditions were present.

\textbf{Covid mortality}: In May, the US health authority CDC published
a cautious ``best estimate'' of covid mortality (IFR) of 0.26\%
(assuming 35\% asymptomatic infections). In July, a
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html}{new
IFR of 0.65\%} was published. However, this new value is not based on
own calculations or new studies, but
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089854v4}{on
a meta-study} in which the existing literature was simply searched for
all previous IFR values.

Thus, the meta-study mainly consists of previous modelling studies as
well as ``raw IFR values'', which are much too high compared to the
actual, population-based IFR values from antibody studies. With few
exceptions, the real IFR values are between 0.1\% and 0.4\%, and when
mucosal and cellular immunity are taken into account, they are
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{approximately
0.1\%} or less.

However, the virus has spread much faster than anticipated, thus causing
a temporarilly high death rate in some places, especially if nursing
homes and hospitals got affected.

\textbf{Non-infectious virus fragments}: The U.S. CDC
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html}{points
out that} in most Covid patients, infectious virus particles are no
longer detectable ten to fifteen days after the first symptoms. However,
non-infectious virus fragments (RNA) can still be found \emph{up to
three months} after the first symptoms. This is likely to be a
significant problem with regard to PCR tests, as many people who have
long since ceased to be infectious still test positive, triggering
far-reaching tracing and quarantine false-alarms.

\textbf{Deaths with or by or without coronavirus}: In England and some
other countries it
\href{https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/why-no-one-can-ever-recover-from-covid-19-in-england-a-statistical-anomaly/}{has
been reported that} all deceased persons who tested positive for the new
coronavirus since the beginning of the year were counted as Covid deaths
-- regardless of the time of the test, a possible recovery, and the
actual cause of death. In the US state of Colorado, it was found that
\href{https://covid19.colorado.gov/data/case-data}{about 10\% of deaths}
were \emph{with} but \emph{not from} coronavirus. In other US states,
further cases of ``corona deaths'' became known that in reality were
test-positive\href{https://cbs12.com/news/local/i-team-deaths-incorrectly-attributed-to-covid-19-in-palm-beach-county}{homicide
victims} and
\href{https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-questions-raised-after-fatal-motorcycle-crash-listed-as-covid-19-death}{motorcycle
accidents}.

\hypertarget{children-and-schools}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Children and

It has been known since March that the risk of disease and transmission
in children is minimal in the case of Covid19. The main reason for this
is probably a pre-existing immunity due to frequent contact with
previous coronaviruses (i.e. cold viruses). There was and is therefore
no medical reason for the closure of primary schools, kindergartens and
day-care centres and for special protective measures in schools.

In the meantime, further studies on this issue have been published:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The British epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse stated that there
  is
  \href{https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-known-case-of-teacher-catching-coronavirus-from-pupils-says-scientist-3zk5g2x6z}{not
  a single confirmed case} of infection of a teacher by a pupil
  worldwide.
\item
  Tracing pioneer Iceland found
  ``\href{https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/blog/hunting-down-covid-19/}{not
  a single case} where a child under 10 infected their parents.''
\item
  A joint report from Sweden (without primary school closure) and
  Finland (with primary school closure) concluded that there was
  \href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-schools-idUSKCN24G2IS}{no
  difference} in infection rates among children in the two countries.
\item
  In the USA, three times more children up to 14 years of age
  \href{https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/if-covid-fatalities-were-90-2-lower-how-would-you-feel-about-schools-reopening/}{have
  died of influenza} than of Covid-19 (101 versus 31) since the
  beginning of the year, according to the CDC.
\item
  A Canadian study found that most of the children with
  ``Kawasaki-like'' inflammatory symptoms
  \href{https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-new-syndrome-in-children-thought-to-be-linked-to-covid-19-yields/}{had
  no corona infection} at all. The disease in children is ``very, very
  rare'', the researchers said.
\item
  A German study came to the conclusion that children act
  epidemiologically
  \href{https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/corona-studie-an-schulen-kinder-eher-bremskloetze-der-infektion-16858827.html}{``like

\begin{itemize}

\item
  The German virologist \textbf{Hendrik Streeck} advocates
  \href{https://www.merkur.de/welt/coronavirus-zweite-welle-impfstoff-streeck-virologe-warnung-drosten-massentest-infektion-zr-13834907.html}{a
  pragmatic approach} to the new coronavirus and targeted measures for
  people at high risk. According to Streeck, the long-term suppression
  of the virus and the hope for a possible vaccine are not sensible
  strategies.
\item
  Professor \textbf{Carl Heneghan}, Director of the Oxford Centre for
  Evidence-Based Medicine,
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3plSbCbkSA}{explains in an
  interview} that there is still no evidence for the effectiveness of
  masks in the general population. A permanent suppression strategy like
  the one in New Zealand is not sensible and causes high damage in the
  long term. The lethality (IFR) of Covid-19 is about 0.1\% to 0.3\% and
  is thus comparable to previous flu epidemics and pandemics.
\item
  The Swedish chief epidemiologist \textbf{Anders Tegnell}
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh9wso6bEAc}{explains in an
  interview} that eradication of the virus is not an option. In Sweden,
  the infections slowed down considerably even without a lockdown, and
  daily deaths now are close to zero. The evidence for the benefit of
  masks is still ``very weak'' and they might even be counterproductive.
  An introduction at this point in time would make no sense. The
  lethality of Covid-19 is between 0.1\% and 0.5\% and does not
  ``radically differ'' from influenza.
\item
  The epidemiologist and systems biologist Professor \textbf{Francois
  Balloux}, Director of the British UCL Genetics Institute,
  \href{https://twitter.com/BallouxFrancois/status/1284513419454971905}{explains
  in an article} that Covid-19 is comparable to a pandemic (but not
  seasonal) influenza. The main difference is the age-risk distribution:
  while Covid-19 is mainly dangerous for older people, a pandemic
  influenza is also life-threatening for younger people and children.
  Professor Balloux points out that the ``Russian influenza pandemic''
  of 1889 may have been triggered by the coronavirus OC-43, which is now
  considered one of the four typical cold viruses.
\item
  The Swiss chief physician for infectiology, Dr. \textbf{Pietro
  Vernazza}, pleads for a
  \href{https://corona-transition.org/der-infektiologe-prof-pietro-vernazza-sieht-covid-19-im-bereich-einer}{``controlled
  natural immunization''} of society as an alternative to the
  ``eradication strategy''. In most cases, Covid-19 is mild and the
  actual mortality rate is about 0.1\%, which is in the range of a
  severe influenza. The Swedes ``did nothing wrong'' with their
  strategy, according to Vernazza.
\item
  The former director of the Institute of Immunology at the University
  of Bern, Professor \textbf{Beda Stadler}, also pleads for a
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBRcK-od50Q}{controlled spread
  of the virus}. The danger of the virus had been overestimated due to
  the false assumption of a lack of immunity. Professor Stadler is
  critical of compulsory masks and mass tests. Stadler, who is now
  emeritus, explains that many younger immunologists no longer dare to
  speak out publicly on the subject due to the extreme polarisation of
  the debate by politics and the media.
\end{itemize}

On the other hand, \textbf{Professor Karin Mölling}, the former head of
the Department of Virology at the University of Zurich and one of the
earliest critical voices on corona measures, has now
\href{https://www.bazonline.ch/eine-zweite-welle-laesst-sich-vermeiden-zumindest-bis-im-winter-959708338566}{partly
changed her opinion}: Due to the sometimes serious lung damage, the
virus should not be underestimated and containment measures are
important.

\hypertarget{the-clinical-picture-of-covid-19}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{The clinical picture of
Covid-19}}{The clinical picture of Covid-19}}\label{the-clinical-picture-of-covid-19}}

The lower-than-expected lethality of Covid-19 should not hide the fact
that the new coronavirus, due to its efficient use of the human ACE2
cell receptor, in some cases can lead to
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0968-3}{severe disease}
with complications in the lung, the vascular and nervous systems and
other organs, some of which can
\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351}{persist
for months}.

While it is true that most of these symptoms can also occur in severe
influenza (including
\href{https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091014111549.htm}{thrombosis}
the temporary loss of the
\href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948436/}{sense of smell}), they
are indeed more frequent and more pronounced in the novel Covid-19
disease.

In addition, even apparently ``mild'' disease (without hospitalization)
can in some cases lead to protracted complications with breathing
problems, fatigue or other symptoms. The US CDC
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm}{came to the
conclusion} that after one month, about one third of the ``mild'' cases
still showed such symptoms. Even in the 18 to 34-year-olds without
preconditions, about 20\% still had after-effects.

On the positive side, researchers at a German clinic recently reported
\href{https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/kontraste/coronavirus-langzeitfolgen-101.html}{good
chances of recovery}: ``We can see that the lungs can heal well, even in
patients who have had three weeks of intensive care''. After three
months, 20\% of the intensive care patients had healthy lungs again, and
in the remaining patients a clear regeneration was visible.

Nevertheless, the primary goal should be to avoid a progression of the
disease.

\hypertarget{on-the-treatment-of-covid-19}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{On the treatment of
Covid-19}}{On the treatment of Covid-19}}\label{on-the-treatment-of-covid-19}}

\textbf{Note}: Patients are asked to consult a doctor.

Many countries adopted the strategy of imposing a lockdown during or
after a wave of infection, thereby locking already infected high-risk
individuals in their homes without treatment until they developed severe
breathing problems and needed intensive care treatment immediately. Even
today, test-positive high-risk persons are often simply quarantined
without treatment.

This is not an ideal approach. Numerous studies and doctors' reports
have now shown that for people at high risk or with high exposure,
\emph{early treatment} immediately on onset of the first typical
symptoms is crucial to avoid disease progression and hospitalization.

Studies and medical reports from various countries in Asia and the West
recommend a
\href{https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/}{combination
protocol} of zinc (which inhibits the RNA replication of coronaviruses),
the antimalarial agent HCQ (which promotes the cellular uptake of zinc
and has other anti-viral properties), and, if necessary, an antibiotic
(to prevent bacterial superinfections) and a blood thinner (to prevent
thrombosis and lung embolism).

Yale professor and physician Harvey A. Risch argues
\href{https://www.newsweek.com/key-defeating-covid-19-already-exists-we-need-start-using-it-opinion-1519535}{in
a recent commentary} that early treatment with HCQ and zinc as well as
an antibiotic has proven to be ``highly effective''. In the USA alone,
according to Professor Risch, 70,000 to 100,000 deaths
\href{https://www.foxnews.com/media/hydroxychloroquine-could-save-lives-ingraham-yale-professor}{could
have been prevented} by the systematic use of HCQ. Risch is therefore
calling for an immediate and prescription-free release of this
medication, as is already the case in many other countries.

Meanwhile, a bizarre battle has broken out in western industrialised
countries over the use of low-cost HCQ, which has been used
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/hcq-white-paper-dr-simone-gold.pdf}{successfully
and safely for decades} in the prevention and treatment of malaria and
several other diseases. This battle appears to be driven in part by
political and commercial interests and may produce a great many
casualties.

Opponents of HCQ went as far as publishing falsified studies and using
lethal doses during trials,
\href{https://www.medicineuncensored.com/a-study-out-of-thin-air}{as Dr.
James Todaro explains}, who uncovered one of these frauds that fooled
top science journals, the WHO and health experts worldwide.

Many of these anti-HCQ activities
\href{https://omnij.org/Gilead:_Twenty-one_billion_reasons_to_discredit_hydroxychloroquine_(ORIGINAL_ARTICLE)}{are
connected to} pharmaceutical company Gilead, which wants to sell a drug
that is over a hundred times more expensive (Remdesivir), but which is
only used on intensive care patients and has some
\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305282}{severe
side effects}.

In addition, a potentially effective early treatment stands in the way
of the billion-dollar global vaccination strategy being pursued by
numerous governments, pharmaceutical companies and vaccine investor Bill
Gates. Directors of vaccine companies have already made
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/business/coronavirus-vaccine-profits-vaxart.html}{about
one billion dollars} with stock and option gains alone, even without yet
delivering a vaccine.

The hope for a safe and effective vaccine, however, still seems
questionable: Contrary to the positive media presentation, in the second
test round of the RNA vaccine from the US company Moderna,
\href{https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/vaccines/letter-to-wv-legislators-the-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-is-likely-to-make-more-people-sick-than-covid-19/}{80\%
of the volunteers} (average age 33 years and healthy) in the medium and
high-dose groups reacted with moderate to severe side effects.

\hypertarget{the-effectiveness-of-face-masks}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{The effectiveness of face
masks}}{The effectiveness of face masks}}\label{the-effectiveness-of-face-masks}}

Various countries are discussing or have already introduced mandatory
face masks in the general population. In the updates of June and July,
however, it was shown that the evidence for the effectiveness of cloth
masks in the general population is
\href{https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/}{still rather weak},
contrary to what is reported in many media.

In previous influenza pandemics, cloth masks
\href{https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article}{had no
influence} on the occurrence of infection. Despite masks, Japan had its
last flu epidemic with
\href{https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/}{more
than five million diseased} just one year ago, in January and February
2019. Even the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in Wuhan could not be
stopped by the widespread use of masks there.

Due to the significantly lower hospitalisation and mortality rates of
Covid-19 (compared to the original assumptions), masks are not
necessarily required to ``flatten the curve''. Masking only makes sense
-- if at all -- in the context of a vaccination strategy that aims to
suppress the virus until a vaccine is available.

BBC medical correspondent Deborah Cohen explained in mid-July that the
partial update of the WHO recommendation on masks was due not to new
evidence but
\href{https://twitter.com/ClarkeMicah/status/1282987860090593280}{``political
lobbying''}: ``We had been told by various sources WHO committee
reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them
due to political lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.''

The ``political lobbying'' is likely referring to the group
\href{https://masks4all.co/about-us/}{``Masks for All''}, which was
founded by a ``Young Leader'' of the Davos forum and which is lobbying
authorities and governments for a worldwide face mask obligation.

In connection with masks, the question also arises as to whether the new
coronavirus can be transmitted over large areas by \textbf{aerosols}.
According to experts, true aerosol transmission even outdoors
\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768396}{still
seems unlikely} -- otherwise the spread of the virus would have a
different dynamic and, contrary to reality, would often be untraceable.

However, an aerosol-like transmission indoors -- especially with closed
air circulation by fans or during intensive activities such as singing
and dancing -- seems increasingly probable or certain due to various
incidents.

In the case of aerosol transmission, however, cloth masks are likely to
offer even less protection than against droplets due to their pore size
and inaccurate fit. This was demonstrated, for example, by the corona
outbreak at the
\href{https://swprs.org/tonnies-corona-ausbruch-trotz-maskenpflicht/}{German
meat processor Toennies}, which occurred at an air-conditioned workplace
over a distance of up to eight metres despite the requirement to wear
masks.

On the question of \textbf{``asymptomatic transmission''}, it can
currently be said that \emph{true asymptomatic transmission} still
\href{https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200609/who-clairifies-comments-on-asymptomatic-covid-spread}{seems
to be rare} according to the WHO (which may explain the very low
transmission rate in children), whereas \emph{pre-symptomatic
transmission} in the days before the first symptoms appear (with already
high virus load) is very likely and may explain the rapid spread of the
virus.

Pre-symptomatic transmission is also known
\href{https://virologydownunder.com/influenza-virus-transmission-with-or-without-symptoms-youre-dropping-flu-virus/}{from
influenza}, but the incubation period of influenza is much shorter, so
this may be somewhat less relevant.

the effectiveness of cloth masks in the general population:

\textbf{Conclusion}: It is still possible that cloth masks can slow down
the rate of infection in the general population, but the evidence for
this is currently limited and the potential benefits are mainly relevant
in the context of a long-term and still uncertain vaccination strategy.

Some particularly skeptical observers still seem to perceive Covid
predominantly as a ``test epidemic''. However, this position has been
untenable for months already.

The best known ``test epidemic'' is the so-called swine flu of
2009/2010, a rather mild influenza virus that only caused worldwide
anxiety due to mass testing and media panic. A commission of the Council
of Europe later called the swine flu a
\href{https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html\#658c006c48e8}{``fake
pandemic''} and a ``big pharma fraud''.

What was noteworthy at the time was that a few months earlier, the WHO
\href{https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html\#658c006c48e8}{changed
its pandemic guidelines} and removed the criterion of increased
lethality. In addition, pharmaceutical companies
\href{https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1242147/The-false-pandemic-Drug-firms-cashed-scare-swine-flu-claims-Euro-health-chief.html}{signed
secret contracts} worth billions with governments for a vaccine that
later led to sometimes serious
\href{https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brain-damaged-uk-victims-swine-flu-vaccine-get-60-million-compensation-1438572}{neurological
damage} and had to be disposed of for the most part.

Finally, researchers discovered that the swine flu virus itself probably
\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1743-422X-6-207}{originated
from vaccine research} and was released through a leak (or worse).

On the other hand, due to its special characteristics -- in particular
the very efficient use of the ACE2 cell receptor -- the new coronavirus
is a dangerous and easily transmissible SARS virus which can cause
severe damage to the lungs, blood vessels and other organs. The good
fortune is that many people already have a certain immunity to the new
virus or at least are able to neutralize it on the mucosal membrane.

Covid-19 is therefore a real and serious pandemic and comparable to the
(\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/covid-19-comparison-e1592927192181.png}{still
stronger}) flu pandemics of 1957/58 (Asian flu) and 1968 to 1970 (Hong
Kong flu). The comparison with the swine flu of 2009 is only possible
because the deaths caused by swine flu were
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/swine-flu-cases-overestimated/}{greatly
exaggerated}.

(On the other hand, it should be remembered that during the 1968/1970
flu pandemic -- or rather in the summer between the two main waves --
the famous
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/}{Woodstock
festival was held} and social life mostly went on as usual).

However, it can be argued that the real Covid19 pandemic has been
amplified by a ``test pandemic'' due to the mass testing in the general
population, causing additional panic and very high costs.

Stanford Professor Scott Atlas
\href{https://www.facebook.com/cnn/posts/10160799274796509}{argued
already in May} that mass testing in the general population is of little
use and that testing should instead be limited to vulnerable
institutions such as nursing homes and hospitals (including for
visitors).

Daily mass testing is also not effective because,
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{according to
antibody studies}, the virus is already much more widespread than PCR
tests show, anyway. Moreover, the tests are susceptible to
false-positive (and false-negative) results and non-infectious virus
fragments.

Countries such as Japan, Sweden and Belarus have shown that the pandemic
can be controlled without a lockdown and without mass testing -- and in
the case of Sweden and Belarus also without masks -- as long as the
sensitive facilities are protected.

\textbf{Conclusion}: Covid-19 is a real and serious pandemic comparable
to the (still stronger) influenza pandemics of 1957 and 1968, but in
addition to the real Covid-19 pandemic, there is indeed a ``test
pandemic'' which causes additional panic and high costs.

The origin of the new SARS coronavirus remains unclear. However,
researchers with access to Chinese documents
\href{https://swprs.org/covid-19-virus-origin-the-mojiang-miners-passage-hypothesis/}{were
able to show in May} that the closest related coronavirus was found in a
mine in southwest China, where six miners contracted Covid-like
pneumonia in 2012 and three of them died.

The miners' illness was clinically virtually identical to today's
(severe) Covid-19, which is why some analysts have proposed to call the
disease\href{https://twitter.com/search?q=\%23covid12\&f=live}{Covid-12}
instead of Covid-19.

The Virological Institute in Wuhan received virus samples from the mine
as well as from the tissue of the deceased miners in 2012 and 2013. It
is conceivable that this virus escaped from the laboratory in autumn
2019.

In addition to the Chinese institute, however, the US health authority
CDC and the US Department of Defense
\href{https://armswatch.com/project-g-2101-pentagon-biolab-discovered-mers-and-sars-like-coronaviruses-in-bats/}{have
also been shown} to be working with SARS-like viruses from bats. The US
NGO ``Eco Health Alliance'' cooperated on this issue with both the US
Pentagon and the Virological Institute in Wuhan.

Direct transmission by an animal is also still conceivable, although
previous candidates such as the well-known animal market in Wuhan or the
Pangolin theory
\href{https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200708/Research-sheds-doubt-on-the-Pangolin-link-to-SARS-CoV-2.aspx}{have

The USA is one of the countries most affected by the new coronavirus so
far. This could have political and medical reasons.

Medically, there are many relevant pre-existing conditions in the US
population, such as obesity, heart problems and diabetes. Air
conditioning systems could promote aerosol-like transmission indoors.
Politically, there have been serious mistakes in dealing with nursing
homes, misplaced incentives in the treatment of patients, and
problematic back-and-forth with lockdowns.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The US already has over 150,000 corona deaths, putting it in the range
  of a pandemic influenza, comparable to the

  and 1968 pandemics}.
\item
  45\% of corona deaths occurred
  \href{https://freopp.org/the-covid-19-nursing-home-crisis-by-the-numbers-3a47433c3f70}{in
  nursing homes}. Over 50\% of all deaths occurred
  \href{https://twitter.com/pdubdev/status/1280195926238261248/photo/1}{in

  \href{https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/if-covid-fatalities-were-90-2-lower-how-would-you-feel-about-schools-reopening/}{from
  other pneumonia diseases} (e.g. influenza), according to the CDC. For
  children and adolescents, Covid is three times less dangerous than
  influenza.

  A
  \href{https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/largest-seroprevalence-study-in-us-shows-vast-covid-19-undercount-67762}{nationwide
  antibody study} showed that the new coronavirus is 6 to 24 times more
  widespread than assumed on the basis of PCR tests, depending on the
  region. However, the antibody levels are still in the single-digit
  percentage range in most regions, indicating that exposure to the
  coronavirus is less much less than 50\% in many places.
\item
  While the number of daily positive tests reached a peak in mid-July
  due to the high number of tests, the
  \href{https://covidusa.net/}{number of daily deaths} was only half as
  high as in April, although recently with a slight upward trend again
  (see graph below).
\item
  In Florida there were reports of at times allegedly very high
  positivity rates. However, an
  \href{https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-florida-department-of-health-says-some-labs-have-not-reported-negative-covid-19-results}{analysis
  showed that} various laboratories only reported the number of positive
  tests and thus an apparent positivity rate of 100\%. The actual
  positivity rate in Florida was mostly in the single-digit percentage
  range. In terms of deaths per capita, Florida remains in the lower
  midfield compared to the other states.
\item
  The median age of Covid deaths in the USA
  \href{https://twitter.com/kylamb8/status/1287952340822175744}{is 78.5
  years}. This is higher than the median age of ``other deaths'', but
  lower than the median age of Covid deaths in Europe (80 to 86).

France was relatively hard hit by the corona pandemic and registered

30,000 corona deaths} by the end of May according to the health
authority SPF. About 50\% of these deaths occurred in nursing homes, the
average age of the deaths is 81.3 years. The median age of
\href{https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/download/260891/2645733}{intensive
care patients} was about 67 years.

The region around Paris, eastern France and northern France were
particularly hard hit, while large parts of western France and
southwestern France were hardly affected at all (so far).

So although only part of France was affected by Covid, the cumulative
excess mortality since the beginning of the year (compared to the
baseline) is about 50\% higher than during the seasonal flu waves of the
past five years. In Greater Paris, the excess mortality rate is even
around 500\% or 10,000 people higher than in previous years (see graphs
below).

Covid deaths accounted for around 16\% of all deaths nationwide, but in
Greater Paris, the figure was almost 40\% of all deaths from early March
to late May. The weekly peak mortality due to Covid-19 is comparable to
the record hot summer of 2003 (see graph below).

Didier Raoult, a well-known professor of medicine and HCQ pioneer from
Marseille, criticized the lack of early treatment and the ban on HCQ
\href{http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/}{at
a parliamentary hearing} at the end of June. Until 2019, HCQ was
available in France without prescription. At the beginning of the
pandemic, however, its use was restricted to clinics and eventually
\href{https://www.france24.com/en/20200527-france-revokes-decree-authorising-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-to-treat-covid-19}{banned
altogether}. The reason for the ban was the
\href{https://omnij.org/Gilead:_Twenty-one_billion_reasons_to_discredit_hydroxychloroquine_(ORIGINAL_ARTICLE)}{falsified
Lancet study} from the end of May (which was later retracted).

In his clinic, Prof. Raoult had been able to reduce the case fatality
rate to a very low 0.9\% by early treatment with HCQ, according to a
\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920302817}{published

Germany counts only about 9000 corona deaths and has not experienced any
significant excess mortality (in population-adjusted terms there was
even a
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/breyer-deutschland-untersterblichkeit.pdf}{slight
undermortality}).

At the end of June, however,
\href{https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Projekte_RKI/SeBluCo_Zwischenbericht.html}{only
1.3\% of blood donors} had IgG antibodies against the new coronavirus.
This value is very low. Even if non-blood donors (including children and
sick persons), T-cells and mucosal (IgA) immunity are taken into
account, exposure of the population to the virus is hardly more than
10\% to 15\%.

This means that the new coronavirus has not yet spread widely in
Germany. The measures or -- more likely -- the anticipation of the
measures by the population therefore seem to have been successful in
this sense (see graph below).

On the other hand, this means that epidemiologically, Germany is
essentially still where it was in April and that the risk of a new and
stronger increase in infections and disease is indeed real. The
comparison with France shows what this can mean.

The German government currently seems to be following a suppression and
vaccination strategy. This strategy is socially and economically costly
and its success remains uncertain. As an alternative or addition, an
\href{https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/}{early treatment
concept} should be examined.

The political corona situation in Germany remains tense. Repeatedly,
sanctions have been imposed on doctors, professors, lawyers and civil
servants who are critical of corona, and in some cases serious attacks
occurred against skeptical journalists and activists.

Since June, an \href{https://corona-ausschuss.de/}{extra-parliamentary
committee of inquiry} consisting of lawyers and medical experts has been
dealing with the German Corona government policy. It should not be
forgotten, however, that the corona pandemic in Germany is probably not
yet over, given that by the end of June, only 1.3\% of blood donors had
IgG antibodies against the virus.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Swiss \textbf{annual excess mortality} is currently close to zero
  (see graph), which is below most flu waves of the last ten years. This
  is due to the mild winter and the very high median age of the
  approximately 1700 corona deaths (84 years). About 50\% of the deaths
  occurred in nursing homes. The effect of the lockdown remains
  questionable.
\item
  In the former \textbf{hotspots Ticino and Geneva}, IgG antibody levels
  in May
  \href{https://infekt.ch/2020/07/sind-es-doch-10x-mehr-covid-19-faelle/}{were
  about 10\%}, about ten times higher than found by daily PCR tests.
  Taking
  \href{https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/}{mucosal
  and cellular immunity} into account, exposure in southern and western
  Switzerland could already be around 50\%. In German-speaking
  Switzerland, however, exposure is likely to be lower. The risk of a
  ``second wave'' is therefore real.
\item
  In principle, the Swiss government is pursuing a \textbf{suppression
  and vaccination strategy}, which it is supplementing with mass
  testing, contact tracing and partial compulsory masking. As an
  alternative, infectiologist Dr. Pietro Vernazza brought up
  the\href{https://corona-transition.org/der-infektiologe-prof-pietro-vernazza-sieht-covid-19-im-bereich-einer}{idea

  Swedish model.

  due to an increase in tests.

  In Sweden, \textbf{daily corona deaths} are now close to zero. The
  overall mortality rate is in the range of earlier strong flu waves.
  Even the monthly peak mortality (in April 2020)
  \href{https://emanuelkarlsten.se/more-swedes-died-in-one-month-1993-and-2000-compared-to-april-2020-why/}{remained

\item
  The example of Sweden (and Belarus) shows that a \textbf{lockdown} was
  not necessary if the population and institutions were well prepared.
  However, from the perspective of many lockdown advocates --
  governments and the media -- this is
  \href{https://emanuelkarlsten.se/multiple-errors-in-the-new-york-times-article-about-swedens-corona-strategy/}{very
  difficult to admit}.

  Sweden is one of the few Western countries that -- on the basis of the

  decision
  \href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-schools-idUSKCN24G2IS}{was
  correct}, too.
\item
  Sweden made \textbf{two real mistakes}, which ironically are not
  covered by most of the media: 1) The nursing homes in the Stockholm
  area were protected too late and caused over 50\% of Swedish deaths.
  2) Sweden had no early treatment strategy that could have reduced the
  hospitalisation and death rates.
\item
  Swedish cities showed an \textbf{IgG antibody prevalence}
  \href{https://www.sll.se/verksamhet/halsa-och-vard/nyheter-halsa-och-vard/2020/07/20-juli-lagesrapport-om-arbetet-med-det-nya-coronaviruset/}{between
  10\% and 20\%} in July, which, together with mucosal and cellular
  immunity, indicates that the population was exposed between 50\% and
  100\%. Sweden is therefore probably the best placed of all western
  countries to start the coming winter.

inhabitants of the Indian capital Delhi already have antibodies against
the new corona virus. This is about 35 times more people than confirmed
by PCR tests.

This means that Delhi (and some other major cities) could already be
beyond or near the herd immunity threshold, taking into account mucosal
and cellular immunity.

Brazil has by now suffered 90,000 Covid deaths and thus ranges between

Chile and Peru currently have an even higher death rate than Brazil
(based on population). With close to 20,000 deaths, Peru is in the range

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{On the development of the

In most Western countries, the peak of coronavirus infections was
already reached in March or April and often before the lockdown. The
peak of deaths in most Western countries was in April. Since then,
hospitalizations and deaths have been declining in most Western
countries (see graphs below).

This development also applies to countries without a lockdown, such as
Sweden, Belarus and Japan. Cumulative annual mortality in most western
countries continues to be
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#overall-mortality}{in
the range of} a mild (e.g. CH, AT, DE) to strong (e.g. USA, UK)
influenza season.

After the end of the lockdowns, the number of corona tests in the
low-risk general population has increased strongly in many countries,
for example in connection with people returning to work and school.

This led to a certain increase in positive test results in some
countries or regions, which was portrayed by many media and authorities
as an allegedly dangerous increase in ``case numbers'' and sometimes led
to new restrictions, even if the rate of positive tests remained very
low.

``Case numbers'' are, however, a
\href{https://swprs.org/corona-media-propaganda/}{misleading figure}
that cannot be equated with sick or infected people. A positive test
can, for example, be due to non-infectious virus fragments, an
asymptomatic infection, a repeated test, or a false-positive result.

Moreover, counting alleged ``case numbers'' is not meaningful simply
because antibody tests and immunological tests
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{have long shown}
that the new coronavirus is up to fifty times more widespread than
assumed on the basis of daily PCR tests.

Rather, the decisive figures are the number of sick people,
hospitalisations and deaths. It should be noted, however, that many
hospitals are now back to normal operation and all patients, including
asymptomatic patients, are additionally tested for the coronavirus.
Therefore, what matters is the number of actual Covid patients in
hospitals and ICUs.

In the case of Sweden, for example, the WHO
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-28/sweden-s-covid-expert-says-the-world-still-doesn-t-understand}{had
to withdraw} the classification as a ``risk country'' after it became
clear that the apparent increase in ``cases'' was due to an increase in
testing. In fact, hospitalisations and deaths in Sweden
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/sweden-icu-deaths-june-28.png}{have
been declining} since April.

Some countries have already been in a state of
\href{https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/\#z-scores-by-country}{below-average
mortality} since May. The reason for this is that the median age of
corona deaths was often higher than the average life expectancy, as
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#care-homes}{up
to 80\% of deaths} occurred in nursing homes.

In countries and regions where the spread of the coronavirus has so far
been greatly reduced, it is nevertheless entirely possible that there
will be a renewed increase in Covid patients. In these cases, early and
effective treatment is important (see below).

Global Covid-19 mortality is currently -- despite the significantly
older population nowadays -- a whole order of magnitude below the flu
pandemics of 1957 (Asian flu) and 1968 (Hong Kong flu) and
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/covid-19-comparison-e1592927192181.png}{in
the range of} the rather mild ``swine flu pandemic'' of 2009.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{On the lethality of
Covid-19}}{On the lethality of Covid-19}}\label{on-the-lethality-of-covid-19}}

Most antibody studies have shown a population-based Infection Fatality
Rate (IFR) \href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{of
0.1\% to 0.3\%}. The US health authority CDC published in May a still
cautious
\href{https://reason.com/2020/05/24/the-cdcs-new-best-estimate-implies-a-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-below-0-3/}{``best
estimate''} of 0.26\% (based on 35\% asymptomatic cases).

At the end of May, however, an immunological study by the University of
Zurich was published, which for the first time showed that the usual
antibody tests that measure antibodies in the blood (IgG and IgM)
\href{https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/}{can
detect at most} \textbf{about one fifth} of all coronavirus infections.

The reason for this is that in most people the new coronavirus is
already neutralised by antibodies on the mucous membrane (IgA) or by
cellular immunity (T cells) and no symptoms or only mild symptoms
develop.

This means that the new coronavirus is probably much more widespread
than previously assumed and the lethality per infection is around five
times lower than previously estimated. The real lethality could
therefore be \textbf{significantly below 0.1\%} and thus in the range of
influenza.

At the same time, the Swiss study may explain why children usually
develop no symptoms~ (due to frequent contact with previous corona cold
viruses), and why even hotspots such as New York City found an antibody
prevalence (IgG/IgM) of at most 20\% -- as this
\href{https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-could-it-be-burning-out-after-20-of-a-population-is-infected-141584}{already
corresponds to} herd immunity.

The Swiss study has in the meantime been confirmed by several more
studies:

  A Swedish study
  \href{https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown}{showed

  T-cell immunity was about twice as common as antibody immunity.
\item

  \href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31483-5/fulltext}{showed

  (preprint)\href{https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-35331/v1}{showed
  that} 81\% of the people who had not yet had contact with the new

  \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6}{showed that}

  no IgG antibodies are detectable after the recovery phase.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Video interview}:
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwQpg62Kflg}{Swedish Doctor:
T-cell immunity and the truth about Covid-19 in Sweden}

In this context, a US study in the journal Science Translational
Medicine, using various indicators,
\href{https://news.psu.edu/story/623797/2020/06/22/research/initial-covid-19-infection-rate-may-be-80-times-greater-originally}{concluded
that} the lethality of Covid-19 was much lower than originally assumed,
but that its spread in some hotspots was up to 80 times faster than
suspected, which would explain the rapid but short-duration increase in
patients.

A study in the \textbf{Austrian ski resort of Ischgl}, one of the first
European ``corona hotspots'', found antibodies
\href{https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000118306133/42-4-prozent-der-bewohner-ischgls-haben-antikoerper-gegen-sars}{in
42\% of the population}. 85\% of the infections went ``unnoticed'' (i.e.
very mild), about 50\% of the infections went completely without
(noticeable) symptoms.

The high antibody value of 42\% in Ischgl was due to the fact that
Ischgl also tested for IgA antibodies in the blood (instead of only
IgM/IgG). Additional tests for mucosal IgA and for T-cells would
undoubtedly have shown even higher immunity levels close to herd
immunity.

Ischgl saw two Covid-related deaths (both of them men over 80 with
preconditions), resulting in a `crude IFR' of 0.26\%. Considering the
population structure and the actual extent of immunity, the
population-based Covid lethality is likely to be below 0.1\%

Due to its rather low lethality, Covid-19 falls at most into level 2 of
the five-level
\href{https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2007/02/hhs-ties-pandemic-mitigation-advice-severity}{pandemic
plan} developed by US health authorities. For this level, only the
\textbf{``voluntary isolation of sick people''} is to be applied, while
further measures such as face masks, school closings, distance rules,
contact tracing, vaccinations and lockdowns of entire societies are not
recommended.

The new immunological results also mean that
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01451-0}{``immunity
passports''} and mass vaccinations are unlikely to work and are
therefore not a useful strategy.

Some media continue to speak of allegedly much higher Covid lethality
levels. However, these media refer to outdated simulation models,
confuse mortality and lethality, or CFR and IFR, or ``raw IFR'' and
population-based IFR.
\href{https://swprs.org/covid19-lethality-how-not-to-do-it/}{More about
these errors here}.

In July, an antibody prevalence of allegedly
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-antibodies.html}{up
to 70\%} was reported in some New York City districts. However, this is
not a population-based figure, but rather antibodies in people who had
visited an urgent care center.

The following graph shows the actual development of corona deaths in
Sweden (no lockdown, no face mask obligation) compared to the forecasts
of Imperial College London (orange: no measures; grey: moderate
measures). Swedish annual all-cause mortality actually is in the range
of a
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/sweden-all-cause-nov-may-1990.jpg}{medium
flu wave} and 3.6\% lower than in previous years.

Why is the new coronavirus harmless for many people, but very dangerous
for some people? The reason has to to with special features of the virus
and the human immune system.

Many people, including almost all children, can neutralise the new
corona virus with an existing immunity (due to contact with previous
corona cold viruses) or through antibodies on the mucous membranes
(IgA), without it causing much damage.

However, if this does not succeed, the virus can penetrate the organism.
There the virus can cause complications in the lung (pneumonia), the
blood vessels (thromboses, embolisms), and other organs due to its
efficient use of the human ACE2 cell receptor.

If in this case the immune system reacts too weakly (in older people) or
too strongly (in some younger people), the course of the disease
\href{https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nick-cordero-dead-bullets-broadway-waitress-actor-was-41-1301841}{can
become critical}.

It has also been confirmed that the symptoms or complications of serious
Covid-19 disease can
\href{https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/covid-19-coronavirus-longterm-symptoms-months/612679/}{last
for weeks or even months} in some cases.

Therefore, the new coronavirus should not be underestimated and
\emph{early} and effective treatment is absolutely crucial for patients
at risk.

In the longer term, the new coronavirus could develop into a typical
cold virus, similar to the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63}{coronavirus
NL63}, which also uses the ACE2 cell receptor and nowadays affects
primarily young children and nursing patients, causing upper and lower
respiratory tract infections.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{On the treatment of
Covid-19}}{On the treatment of Covid-19}}\label{on-the-treatment-of-covid-19-1}}

\textbf{Note}: Patients are asked to consult a doctor.

Several studies have now confirmed what some front-line physicians have
been saying since March: Early treatment of Covid patients with zinc and
the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
\href{https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/}{is indeed
effective}. US doctors have reported a reduction in hospitalisation
rates \href{https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202007.0025/v1}{of up
to 84\%} and a stabilisation of the health condition often
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVs_EWVCVPc}{within a few hours}.

Zinc has antiviral properties, HCQ supports zinc absorption and has
additional antiviral properties. These drugs are supplemented by doctors
if necessary with an antibiotic (to prevent a bacterial superinfection)
and a blood thinner (to prevent infection-related thromboses and
embolisms).

The alleged or actual negative results with HCQ in some studies were
based, according to the current state of knowledge, on
\href{https://c19study.com/}{delayed use} (intensive care patients),
\href{http://www.francesoir.fr/politique-monde/oxford-recovery-et-solidarity-overdosage-two-clinical-trials-acts-considered}{excessive
doses} (up to 2400mg per day), manipulated
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine}{data
sets}, or ignored
\href{https://www.iss.it/en/rapporti-covid-19/-/asset_publisher/btw1J82wtYzH/content/id/5334891}{contraindications}
(e.g., favism or heart problems).

Sadly, the WHO, many media and some authorities may have caused
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ}{considerable and
unnecessary damage} to public health in recent months through their
negative stance, which may have been politically motivated or influenced
by pharmaceutical interests.

French professor of medicine Jaouad Zemmouri, for example, estimates
that Europe
\href{https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/06/306587/moroccan-scientist-moroccos-chloroquine-success-reveals-european-failures/}{could
have avoided} up to 78\% of Covid deaths by adopting a consistent HCQ
treatment strategy.

HCQ contraindications such as favism or heart problems need to be
considered, but the recent
\href{https://www.henryford.com/news/2020/07/hydro-treatment-study}{Ford
Medical Center study} achieved a reduction in hospital deaths of around
50\% even with 56\% African-American patients (who more often have
favism).

However, the crucial point in the treatment of high-risk patients is
\textbf{early intervention} as soon as the first typical symptoms
develop and even without a PCR test in order to prevent progression of
the disease and avoid intensive care hospitalization.

Most countries did the exact opposite: after the infection wave in
March, they imposed a lockdown, so that infected and frightened people
were locked up in their homes without treatment and often waited until
they developed severe respiratory distress and had to be taken directly
to the intensive care unit, where they were often sedated and intubated
and were likely to die.

It is conceivable that a zinc HCQ combination protocol, which is simple,
safe and inexpensive, could make more complex drugs, vaccinations and
measures largely obsolete.

More recently, a case study from France
\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305282}{showed
that} in four of the first five patients treated with the much more
expensive drug Remdesivir from the pharmaceutical company Gilead,
treatment had to be discontinued due to liver issues and kidney failure.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{On the effectiveness of
masks}}{On the effectiveness of masks}}\label{on-the-effectiveness-of-masks}}

Various countries have introduced or are currently discussing the
introduction of mandatory masks in public transport, in shopping malls,
or generally in public.

Some may argue that the discussion has become largely obsolete because
of the lower-than-expected lethality and
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#hospitalizations}{hospitalization
rate} of Covid-19 and the available treatment options, which have mostly
eased the initial concern of ``flattening the curve''.

Nevertheless, the question of the effectiveness of masks can be asked.
In the case of influenza epidemics, the answer
\href{https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article}{is already
clear} from a scientific point of view: masks in everyday life have no
or very little effect. If used improperly, they can even increase the
risk of infection.

Ironically, the best and most recent example of this is the
often-mentioned Japan: Despite its ubiquitous masks, Japan experienced
its most recent
\href{https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/}{strong
flu wave} -- with around five million people falling ill -- just one
year ago, in January and February 2019.

However, unlike SARS corona viruses, influenza viruses are transmitted
also by children. Indeed, Japan had to close around ten thousand schools
in 2019 due to acute outbreaks of the flu.

With the SARS 1 virus of 2002 and 2003, there is
\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x}{some
evidence} that \emph{medical} masks can provide partial protection
against infection. But SARS-1 spread almost exclusively in hospitals,
i.e. in a professional environment, and hardly to the general public at
large.

In contrast, a study from 2015
\href{https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577}{showed that} the
cloth masks in use today are permeable to 97\% of viral particles due to
their pore size and can further increase the risk of infection by
storing moisture.

Some studies recently argued that everyday masks are nevertheless
effective in the case of the new coronavirus and could at least prevent
the infection of other people. However, these studies suffer from poor
methodology and sometimes show the opposite of what they claim.

Typically, these studies ignore the effect of other simultaneous
measures, the natural development of infection numbers, changes in test
activity, or they compare countries with very different conditions.

An overview:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A German study \href{http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf\#page=28}{claimed
  that} the introduction of compulsory masks in German cities had led to
  a decrease in infections. But the data does not support this: in some
  cities there was no change, in others a decrease, in others an
  increase in infections (see graph below). The city of Jena, presented
  as a model, simultaneously introduced the
  \href{https://www.mdr.de/thueringen/ost-thueringen/jena/corona-jena-seit-einer-woche-keine-neuinfektion-100.html}{strictest
  quarantine rules} in Germany, but the study did not mention this.
\item
  A study in the journal PNAS
  \href{https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857}{claimed that} masks
  had led to a decrease in infections in three hotspots (including New
  York City). This did not take into account the natural decrease in
  infections and other measures. The study was so flawed that over 40
  scientists recommended that the study
  \href{https://reason.com/2020/06/22/prominent-researchers-say-a-widely-cited-study-on-wearing-masks-is-badly-flawed/}{be
  withdrawn}.
\item
  A US study
  \href{https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818}{claimed
  that} compulsory masks had led to a decrease in infections in 15
  states. The study did not take into account that the incidence of
  infection was already declining in most states at that time. A
  comparison with other states was not made.
\item
  A Canadian study
  \href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231v3.full.pdf}{claimed
  that} countries with compulsory masks had fewer deaths than countries
  without compulsory masks. But the study compared African, Latin
  American, Asian and Eastern European countries with very different
  infection rates and population structures.
\item
  A meta-study in the journal Lancet
  \href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext}{claimed
  that} masks ``could'' lead to a reduction in the risk of infection,
  but the studies considered mainly hospitals (Sars-1) and the strength
  of the evidence was reported as ``low''.
\end{enumerate}

The medical benefit of compulsory masks therefore continues to
\href{https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data}{remain
questionable}. A comparative study by the University of East Anglia, for
instance, came to the conclusion that compulsory masks had
\href{https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown}{no
measurable effect} on the incidence of Covid infections or deaths.

It is also clear that widespread use of face masks couldn't stop the
initial outbreak in Wuhan.

Sweden showed that even without a lockdown, without mandatory masks and
with one of the lowest
\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8}{intensive
care bed capacities} in Europe, hospitals need not be overburdened. In
fact, Sweden's annual all-cause mortality has remained in the range of
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/sweden-all-cause-nov-may-1990.jpg}{previous
flu seasons}.

At any rate, authorities shouldn't suggest to the population that
mandatory masks reduce the risk of infection, for example in public
transport, as there is no evidence of this. Whether with or without
masks, there is an increased risk of infection in densely packed indoor
areas.

Interestingly, the demand for a worldwide obligation to wear masks is
led by a lobby group called
\href{https://masks4all.co/about-us/}{``masks4all''} (masks for all),
which was founded by a ``young leader'' of the Davos forum.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{The role of contact

Numerous countries have introduced smartphone apps and special units for
``contact tracing''. However, there is no evidence that these can make
an epidemiologically relevant contribution.

In the case of tracing pioneer Iceland, the app has
\href{https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001541/iceland-rakning-c19-covid-contact-tracing/}{largely
failed}, in Norway it
\href{https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/norway-to-halt-covid-19-track-and-trace-app-on-data-protection-concerns/ar-BB15uMEM}{was

other countries it
\href{https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1001360/india-aarogya-setu-covid-app-mandatory/}{became
mandatory} after all, in Israel contact tracing is operated
\href{https://www.jewishpress.com/news/the-courts/state-to-high-court-even-more-shin-bet-involvement-in-fighting-the-coronavirus/2020/04/14/}{directly
by the} secret service.

A WHO study on influenza pandemics in 2019 came to the conclusion that
contact tracing is not useful from an epidemiological point of view and
\href{https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf\#page=9}{``is
not recommended in any circumstances''}. The typical area of application
is rather sexually transmitted diseases or food poisoning.

Moreover, serious concerns about data protection and civil rights
remain.

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcQFTzck_c}{warned as early as
March} that governments could use the corona crisis as an occasion or
pretext for expanding global surveillance and control, thus creating an
``architecture of oppression''.

A whistleblower who had taken part in a training program for contact
tracers in the US
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUyZWw7qoc}{described it as}
``totalitarian'' and a ``danger to society''.

Swiss computer science professor Serge Vaudenay
\href{https://lasec.epfl.ch/people/vaudenay/swisscovid.html}{showed
that} the contact tracing protocols are by no means ``decentralized''
and ``transparent'', because the actual functionality is implemented
through a Google and Apple interface (GAEN) that is not ``open source''.

This interface has now been integrated by Google and Apple into
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/apple-google-bring-covid-19-contact-tracing-to-3-billion-people}{three
billion mobile phones}. According to Prof. Vaudenay, the interface may
record and store all contacts, not just those that are medically
``relevant''. A German IT expert, for his part, described tracing apps
as a

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{On the origin of the new

In the June update it was shown that renowned virologists consider a
laboratory origin of the new coronavirus to be
\href{https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/}{``at
least as plausible''} as a natural origin. This is due to some genetic
peculiarities of the virus in the receptor binding domain, which lead to
high infectivity in humans.

In the meantime, further evidence for this hypothesis has emerged. More

\end{itemize}

Developments since the beginning of 2020 show that the new coronavirus
cannot be seen as a ``bioweapon'' in the strict sense of the term, as it
is not deadly enough and not targeted enough. However, it may well cause
fear among the population and be exploited politically.

Nevertheless, besides a potential lab origin, a natural origin continues
to be a realistic possibility, even though the ``Wuhan wet market''

**

Stanford professor John Ioannidis published an
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{overview of
Covid-19 antibody studies}. According to his analysis, the lethality of
Covid19 (IFR) is below 0.16\% in most countries and regions. Ioannidis
found an upper limit of 0.40\% for three hotspots.

In its
\href{https://reason.com/2020/05/24/the-cdcs-new-best-estimate-implies-a-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-below-0-3/}{latest
report,} the US health authority CDC reduced the Covid19 lethality (IFR)
to 0.26\% (best estimate). Even this value may still be seen as an upper
limit, since the CDC conservatively assumes 35\% asymptomatic cases,
while most studies indicate
\href{https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1375}{50 to 80\%}
asymptomatic cases.

At the end of May, however, Swiss immunologists led by Professor Onur
Boyman published what is probably the
\href{https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/}{most
important study} on Covid19 lethality to date. This preprint study comes
to the conclusion that the usual antibody tests that measure antibodies
in the blood (IgG and IgM) can recognize \textbf{at most one fifth} of
all Covid19 infections.

The reason for this discrepancy is that in most people the new
coronavirus is already neutralized by antibodies on the mucous membrane
(IgA) or by cellular immunity (T-cells). In most of these cases, no
symptoms or only mild symptoms develop.

This means that the new coronavirus is probably much more common than
previously thought and the lethality per infection is up to five times
lower than previously assumed. The real lethality could thus be
\textbf{well below 0.1\%} and hence in the range of strong seasonal
influenza.

In fact, several studies have now shown that up to 60\% of all people
already have a certain
\href{https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3}{cellular
immunity} to Covid-19, which was acquired through contact with previous
coronaviruses (common cold viruses). Children in particular often come
into contact with such coronaviruses, which could help explain their
insensitivity to Covid19.

The new Swiss study may also explain why antibody studies even in
\textbf{hotspots} like New York or Madrid found infection rates of
\href{https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-results-completed-antibody-testing}{at
most about 20\%}, as this would correspond to an actual rate of nearly
100\%. In many regions, the actual prevalence might already be well
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{over 50\%} and
thus in the range of ​​herd immunity.

Should the Swiss study be confirmed, the assessment of Oxford
epidemiologist Prof. \textbf{Sunetra Gupta} would apply**,** who
predicted early on that Covid-19 is very widespread and its lethality
\href{https://unherd.com/2020/05/oxford-doubles-down-sunetra-gupta-interview/}{below
0.1\%}.

Despite the comparatively low \textbf{lethality} of Covid-19 (deaths per
infection), the \textbf{mortality} (deaths per population) can still be
increased regionally and in the short term if the virus spreads rapidly
and reaches high risk groups, especially patients in nursing homes, as
indeed happened in several hotspots (see below).

Due to its rather low lethality, Covid-19 falls at most into level 2 of
the five-level
\href{https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2007/02/hhs-ties-pandemic-mitigation-advice-severity}{pandemic
plan} developed by US health authorities. For this level, only the
\textbf{``voluntary isolation of sick people''} is to be applied, while
further measures such as face masks, school closings, distance rules,
contact tracing, vaccinations and lockdowns of entire societies are not
recommended.

Regarding \textbf{contact tracing}, a WHO study on influenza pandemics
from 2019 also came to the conclusion that from a medical point of view
this is
\href{https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf}{``under
no circumstances recommended''}, since it is not expedient for easily
communicable and generally mild respiratory diseases.

It is sometimes argued that the rather low lethality was not known at
the beginning of the pandemic. This is not entirely true, as data from
South Korea, the cruise ships and even from Italy already
\href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/}{showed
in March} that the risk to the general population is rather low.

Many health authorities also knew this, as
\href{https://www.thelocal.dk/20200529/leaked-emails-show-how-denmarks-pm-steam-rollered-her-own-health-agency}{leaked
emails from Denmark} in mid-March show: ``The Danish Health Authority
continues to consider that Covid-19 cannot be described as a generally
dangerous disease, as it does not have either a usually serious course
or a high mortality rate.''

Some media nevertheless continue to calculate an allegedly much higher
Covid19 lethality rate of sometimes over 1\% by simply
\href{https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-14/antibody-study-shows-just-5-of-spaniards-have-contracted-the-coronavirus.html}{dividing}
deaths by ``infections'', without taking into account the age and risk
distribution, which is absolutely crucial especially for Covid19.

The latest data from the European mortality monitoring
\href{https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/}{Euromomo} shows that
several countries such as France, Italy and Spain are already entering a
\textbf{below-average mortality}. The reason for this is that the
average age of Covid19 deaths was very high and fewer people than usual
are now dying in this age group.

\hypertarget{the-role-of-nursing-homes}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{The role of nursing

Nursing homes played an
\href{https://ltccovid.org/2020/04/12/mortality-associated-with-covid-19-outbreaks-in-care-homes-early-international-evidence/}{absolute
key role} in the Covid 19 pandemic. In most countries, one to two thirds
of all Covid19 deaths occurred in nursing homes, and
\href{https://freopp.org/the-covid-19-nursing-home-crisis-by-the-numbers-3a47433c3f70}{up
to 80\%} in Canada and some US states. Even in Sweden, which did not
impose a lockdown,
\href{https://www.thelocal.se/20200525/swedish-death-toll-passes-4000-as-coronavirus-cases-in-care-homes-start-to-fall}{75\%
of deaths} occurred in nursing facilities.

It is all the more worrying that some authorities have \emph{obliged}
their nursing homes to admit Covid patients from the clinics, which has
almost always resulted in numerous new infections and deaths. This
happened in
\href{https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/the-massacre-of-italy-s-elderly-nursing-home-residents-35575}{northern
Italy}, England and the heavily affected US states of
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/12/calls-for-independent-probe-of-gov-cuomos-nursing-home-policies/}{New
York}, New Jersey and
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/13/pennsylvania-health-official-moved-mother-from-nursing-home/}{Pennsylvania}.

It is also known from northern Italy that the widespread fear of the
virus and the announced lockdown of the country led to the flight of the
predominantly Eastern European nurses, which
\href{https://swprs.org/covid-19-a-report-from-italy/}{further
accelerated} the breakdown of elderly care.

In the United States,
\href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2020/05/26/nursing-homes-assisted-living-facilities-0-6-of-the-u-s-population-43-of-u-s-covid-19-deaths/}{at
least 42\% of} all Covid19 deaths are accounted for by 0.6\% of the
population living in nursing homes. Nursing homes require targeted
protection and do not benefit from a general lockdown of society as a
whole.

It is well known that even common corona viruses (cold viruses) can be
very dangerous for people in nursing homes. Stanford professor John
Ioannidis pointed out already in mid-March that coronaviruses may have a
case
\href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/}{mortality
rate of up to 8\%} in nursing homes.

In addition, it is often not clear whether these people really died from
Covid-19 or from weeks of stress and total isolation. For example, there
were approximately 30,000 additional deaths in English nursing homes,
but in only 10,000 cases, Covid19 is noted
\href{https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1931}{on the death
certificate}.

In April alone, around
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/covid-19-causing-10000-dementia-deaths-beyond-infections-research-says}{10,000
additional dementia patients} \emph{without} corona infection died in
England and Wales due to weeks of isolation. Investigations into the
situation in nursing homes have been
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/italian-police-broaden-care-home-coronavirus-milan}{initiated}
or
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/12/calls-for-independent-probe-of-gov-cuomos-nursing-home-policies/}{requested}
in several countries.

\hypertarget{the-role-of-hospitals}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{The role of
hospitals}}{The role of hospitals}}\label{the-role-of-hospitals}}

The second central factor regarding infections and deaths, in addition
to the nursing homes, are the hospitals themselves. A
\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044}{case
study in Wuhan} already showed that around 41\% of hospitalized Covid
patients had in fact contracted Covid in the hospital itself.

Contagion in hospitals also played a
\href{https://medium.com/\%40tepper_jonathan/ground-zero-when-the-cure-is-worse-than-the-disease-3c513d91393d}{decisive
role} in northern Italy, Spain, England and other regions that were
severely affected, meaning that the clinics themselves became the main
place of transmission of Covid19 to already weakened people (so-called
nosocomial infection) -- an issue that had already been
\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00523.x}{observed}
during the SARS outbreak from 2003.

Based on current knowledge, those countries that managed to avoid
outbreaks of infection in nursing homes and hospitals had comparatively
few deaths. The general lockdown of society, however, played no role or
even a counterproductive role (see below).

An additional factor is the sometimes fatal medical mistreatment of
Covid patients with aggressive drugs or invasive ventilation, the risks
of which experts
\href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/06/covid19-are-ventilators-killing-people/}{have
been warning about} for months. In the US, for example, there have been
questionable
\href{https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/}{financial
incentives} to connect Covid patients to ventilators, a practice that is
now
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/northwell-health-probing-use-of-ventilators-for-covid-patients/}{being
investigated} in several states.

The well-known Hamburg medical examiner Professor Klaus Püschel
presented his
\href{https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2003}{study} (English)
on the first 12 of 190 detailed corona autopsies at a
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXhxorBBPYI}{press conference}
(German).

Professor Püschel again emphasized that Covid-19 ``is not nearly as
threatening as was initially suspected''. The danger was ``too much
influenced by media images''. The media had focused on severe individual
cases and fueled panic with ``completely wrong messages''. Covid-19 is
not a ``killer virus'' and the call for new medicine or vaccines is
``driven by fear, not facts.''

The specific cause of death of the examined cases was pneumonia, but in
about 50\% of the cases there were venous thrombosis in the legs, which
can lead to fatal pulmonary embolism. The kidneys and heart muscle were
also partially affected. Professor Püschel therefore recommends the
preventive administration of blood-thinning medication for serious Covid
cases.

With regard to thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, Professor Püschel --
like other experts before -- emphasized that a ``lockdown'' with
quarantine at home was ``exactly the wrong measure'', since the lack of
exercise itself promotes thrombosis. Indeed, US specialists have already
been
\href{https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1258625618431954945}{warning}
of this risk after even
\emph{Covid-negative}\href{https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1259548620724080640}{people}
developed
\href{https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1259634922161147910}{unexpected}
thrombosis.

Many media again misinterpreted the autopsy findings and spoke of
Covid-19 as a particularly dangerous disease which, unlike influenza, is
said to lead to thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This is not true,
however: it has been
\href{https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874}{known}
for 50 years that even severe influenza can
\href{https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(15)00284-8/pdf}{greatly
increase}\href{https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091014111549.htm}{the
risk} of thrombosis and embolism and can affect the
\href{https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/7/3/231/755276}{heart
muscle} and other organs. Even the recommendation regarding preventive
blood thinner for severe influenza has been around
\href{https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874}{for
50 years}already.

Numerous studies
\href{https://thehill.com/opinion/education/500349-science-says-open-the-schools}{have
now shown} that children hardly get Covid19 and do not or hardly
transmit the virus, which was
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30095-X/fulltext}{already
known} from the 2003 SARS outbreak. There was
therefore\href{https://infekt.ch/2020/04/schulen-schliessen-hilfreich-oder-nicht/}{no
medical reason} for the closure of schools at any time.

Accordingly, all those
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-denmark-reopening/opening-schools-in-denmark-did-not-worsen-outbreak-data-shows-idUSKBN2341N7}{countries}
that reopened their schools in May saw
\href{https://www.cgdev.org/blog/back-school-tracking-covid-cases-schools-reopen}{no
increase} in cases of infection. Countries like Sweden, which never
closed their primary schools anyway, had no problems with this either.

A preprint study by the German virologist Christian Drosten argued that
the risk of infection from children is comparable to adults and schools
should therefore remain closed. However, several researchers
demonstrated
\href{https://www.nau.ch/news/europa/coronavirus-forscher-drangen-drosten-zum-ruckzug-der-kinder-studie-65714012}{methodological
errors} in the study. Drosten subsequently withdrew the recommendation
regarding school closures.

In some schools, for example in France and Israel, alleged
\href{https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/03/868507524/israel-orders-schools-to-close-when-covid-19-cases-are-discovered}{``corona
outbreaks'' are} said to have occurred. However, it is likely that these
are transmissions from teachers to schoolchildren that, to their dismay,
are regularly tested, although they hardly show any symptoms and are
themselves hardly or not at all contagious.

The British \emph{Kawasaki Disease Foundation} again criticized the
\href{https://www.societi.org.uk/kawasaki-disease-and-covid-19/}{dubious
and lurid media coverage of}\emph{Kawasaki disease}. In fact, there has
been no significant increase in Kawasaki cases and no proven association
with Covid-19. General inflammatory reactions in individual children are
also known from other viral infections, but the number of cases reported
so far is extremely low.

German medical associations
\href{https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article208075525/Corona-Kitas-und-Grundschulen-vollstaendig-oeffnen-uneingeschraenkt.html}{have
also given the all-clear}: Covid-19 is imperceptible or very mild in
almost all children. Schools and daycare centers should therefore be
opened immediately and without restrictions, ie there is no need for
small groups, distance rules or masks.

\hypertarget{on-the-effectiveness-of-masks-1}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{On the effectiveness of
masks}}{On the effectiveness of masks}}\label{on-the-effectiveness-of-masks-1}}

Regardless of the comparatively low lethality of Covid19 in the general
population (see above), there is still no scientific evidence for the
effectiveness of masks in healthy and asymptomatic people in everyday
life.

A cross-country study by the University of East Anglia came to the
conclusion that a mask requirement was of
\href{https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown}{no
benefit} and could even increase the risk of infection.

Two US professors and experts in respiratory and infection protection
from the University of Illinois explain
\href{https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data}{in
an essay} that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as
self-protection \emph{nor to protect third parties} (so-called source
control). The widespread use of masks didn't prevent the outbreak in the
Chinese city of Wuhan, either.

A study from April 2020 in the journal \emph{Annals of Internal
Medicine} \href{https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1342}{came
to the conclusion} that neither fabric masks nor surgical masks can
prevent the spread of the Covid19 virus by coughing.

An article in the \emph{New England Journal of Medicine} from May 2020
also comes to the conclusion that face masks offer
\href{https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372}{little or no
protection} in everyday life. The call for a mask requirement is
described as an ``irrational fear reflex''.

A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the U.S. CDC
\href{https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article}{also
found} that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective
equipment nor as a source control.

A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open
\href{https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577}{found that} cloth
masks were penetrated by 97\% of particles and may increase infection
risk by retaining moisture or reuse of the masks.

The WHO moreover declared in June that truly ``asymptomatic
transmission'' is in fact
\href{https://www.nationalreview.com/news/who-says-transmission-by-asymptomatic-covid-patients-very-rare/}{``very
rare''}, as data from numerous countries showed. Some of the few
confirmed cases were due to
\href{https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1235_article}{direct
body contact}, i.e. shaking hands or kissing.

In Austria, the face mask requirement in retail and catering will
\href{https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000117792769/die-maske-wird-wieder-zurueckgedraengt}{be
lifted again} from mid-June. A mask requirement was
\href{https://www.thelocal.se/20200514/explained-why-is-sweden-not-recommending-face-masks-to-the-public}{never
introduced} in Sweden because it ``does not offer additional protection
for the population'', as the Swedish health authority explained.

Numerous politicians, media people and police officers have already
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2qAKS6Hl4I}{been caught} putting
on their face masks in a crowd especially for the
\href{https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1265382872631980032}{television
cameras} or taking them off immediately when they
\href{https://twitter.com/realPowerTie/status/1261445611594723330}{believed
that} they were no longer being filmed.

In some cases there were
\href{https://twitter.com/DrRJKavanagh/status/1260739779177656325}{brutal
police attacks} because a person allegedly ``did not wear her mask
properly''. In other cases, people with a disability who cannot and do
not have to wear a mask, are
\href{https://bnn.de/lokales/karlsruhe/maskenpflicht-behinderte-sind-befreit-und-werden-dafuer-teils-beschimpft}{not
allowed to enter} department stores .

Despite this evidence, a group called
\href{https://masks4all.co/about-us/}{``masks4all''}, which was founded
by a ``young leader'' of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos, is
advocating worldwide mask requirements. Several governments
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/who-updates-face-masks-recommendations-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-6}{and
the WHO} appear to be responding to this campaign.

Many critics suspect that the masks are more likely to have a
psychological or
\href{https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/maskenpflicht-gesellschaftliches-klima}{political
function}(``muzzle'' or ``visible sign of obedience'') and that wearing
them frequently might even lead to additional health problems.

A study from Germany empirically showed that the introduction of face
masks \href{http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf\#page=28}{had no effect} on
infection rates (see graph). Only the city of Jena appeared to
experience a strong decrease in infections, but Jena simultaneously
introduced
\href{https://www.mdr.de/thueringen/ost-thueringen/jena/corona-jena-seit-einer-woche-keine-neuinfektion-100.html}{very
strict} quarantine regulations.

\hypertarget{on-the-origin-of-the-virus}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{On the origin of the
virus}}{On the origin of the virus}}\label{on-the-origin-of-the-virus}}

In mid-March, some researchers argued in a letter to the journal Nature
Medicine that the Covid19 virus must be of
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9}{natural origin}
and not ``from a laboratory''. They cited the structure of the virus and
the fact that the binding to the human ACE2 cell receptor did not
correspond to the theoretical maximum.

In the meantime, however, numerous
\href{https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/}{renowned
virologists} have
\href{https://gmwatch.org/en/news/latest-news/19412-lab-escape-theory-of-sars-cov-2-origin-gaining-scientific-support}{contradicted}this
argument. An artificial origin in the context of virological
\href{https://medium.com/\%40yurideigin/lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748}{functional
research} is ``at least as plausible'' as a natural origin. In fact,
coronaviruses of this kind have been intensively
\href{https://gmwatch.org/en/news/latest-news/19410-chinese-and-us-scientists-genetically-engineered-bat-coronaviruses-in-dangerous-gain-of-function-research-stretching-back-years}{researched}
in several laboratories for almost 20 years (i.e. since the SARS
outbreak in 2003), they say.

Arguments \emph{in favour} of an artificial origin include in particular
that the binding to the human ACE2 cell receptor is
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06199}{significantly stronger} than in
all common source animals and that no direct source animal could be
identified so far. In addition, the virus contains some striking
functional
\href{https://gmwatch.org/en/news/latest-news/19403-wuhan-and-us-scientists-used-undetectable-methods-of-genetic-engineering-on-bat-coronaviruses}{gene
sequences} that might have been inserted artificially (see graphic
below).

The initial theory of the animal market in Wuhan has since been
\href{https://thebulletin.org/2020/06/did-the-sars-cov-2-virus-arise-from-a-bat-coronavirus-research-program-in-a-chinese-laboratory-very-possibly}{rejected}
because none of the animals there tested positive and a third of the
very first patients had no connection to the animal market. The animal
market is now seen as a secondary place of transmission.

It is known that the virological laboratory in Wuhan, in collaboration
with the United States and France,
\href{https://www.newsweek.com/dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan-lab-millions-us-dollars-risky-coronavirus-research-1500741}{researched}
coronaviruses and thereby also generated ``potentially pandemic
pathogens'' (PPP) that are particularly easy to transmit and / or
particularly dangerous. In addition, there have been several
\href{https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-long-history-of-accidental-laboratory-releases-of-potential-pandemic-pathogens/}{laboratory
accidents} with virus releases in China and the USA.

The unbiased observer must therefore continue to consider several
realistic options: a natural origin of the virus (as assumed with SARS
2003), a \href{https://project-evidence.github.io/}{laboratory accident}
as part of functional research (probably in Wuhan), or even a targeted
release by a geopolitically interested actor in the East or West.

Nevertheless, the Covid19 virus is not a ``biological weapon'' in the
classic sense: the virus is
\href{https://leelabvirus.host/covid19/origins-part2}{very easily
transmissible}, but not particularly dangerous for the general
population. Animal studies have shown that much more deadly corona
viruses can be generated.

\hypertarget{vaccines-against-covid-19}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Vaccines against
Covid-19}}{Vaccines against Covid-19}}\label{vaccines-against-covid-19}}

Various politicians in Europe and the US have declared that the ``corona
crisis'' can only be ended by a vaccine that is currently being
developed.

However, many experts have
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9}{pointed out}
that an express vaccine against the new coronavirus is
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrL9QKGQrWk}{not necessary} or
useful due to the overall
\href{https://www.bitchute.com/video/DXxeej9CW1pz/}{low lethality} (see
above) and the already
\href{https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/no-vaccine-for-coronavirus-a-possibility/news-story/34e678ae205b50ea983cc64ab2943608}{declining
spread}. The protection of risk groups, especially in nursing homes,
could be much
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-haseltine-newsmake-idUSKBN22W34T}{more
targeted}.

Some experts like the Swiss infectiologist Dr. Pietro Vernazza also
pointed out that experience shows that the high-risk group in particular
benefits
\href{https://infekt.ch/2020/05/corona-impfung-als-ultimative-rettung/}{the
least} from vaccination, since their immune system no longer reacts
adequately to the vaccine.

Various experts have also
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9}{pointed out}
the
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-insight-idUSKBN20Y1GZ}{significant
health risks} of an express vaccine. In fact, vaccination against the
so-called ``swine flu'' from 2009/2010, for example, led to sometimes
\href{https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brain-damaged-uk-victims-swine-flu-vaccine-get-60-million-compensation-1438572}{severe
neurological damage,} particularly in children, and to claims for
damages in the millions.

Nevertheless, several billion dollars of private and public funds have
already been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/europe/eu-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{collected}
for the development of a vaccine. An ``immunity certificate'' for work
and travel is
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/03/coronavirus-health-passports-for-uk-possible-in-months}{still
being discussed}. However, contrary to most media reports, the two
leading
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31252-6/fulltext}{vaccine
projects} had some serious complications.

In the case of the \textbf{Oxford University} vaccine, in animal
experiments
\href{https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8331709/Oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-does-not-stop-infection-experts-warn.html}{all
six rhesus monkeys} fell ill with Covid19 despite vaccination and were
as infectious as the unvaccinated monkeys. Nevertheless, the vaccine was
moved on to the human test phase. However, the project manager explained
that the coronavirus had already \emph{become so rare} in the population
that the clinical trial may
\href{https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/23/oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-trial-has-50-per-cent-chance/}{deliver
no result}.

In the case of the novel RNA vaccine from \textbf{Moderna}, which was
unusually
\href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/researchers-rush-to-start-moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-without-usual-animal-testing/}{tested}
directly in human experiments, 20\% of the participants in the high-dose
group had a
\href{https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/vaccine-trial-catastrophe-moderna-vaccine-has-20-serious-injury-rate-in-high-dose-group/}{``serious
side effect''}, although Moderna only allowed very healthy people to try
it.

One of the Moderna participants was then presented and interviewed by
CNN as a ``hero''. However, it was agreed not to mention that the
participant passed out after the vaccination and became
\href{https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/modernas-guinea-pig-sickest-in-his-life-after-being-injected-with-experimental-vaccine/}{``as
sick as never before in his life''}. Several experts also criticized
Moderna for
\href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/19/vaccine-experts-say-moderna-didnt-produce-data-critical-to-assessing-covid-19-vaccine/}{not
disclosing} their clinical data sufficiently.

The director of the US Corona Vaccine Rapid Development Program was
himself previously a
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/moncef-slaoui-leading-trump-vaccine-push-10m-holding-moderna-conflict-2020-5}{director
at Moderna}. President Trump also announced that the vaccine might be
distributed nationwide
\href{https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-says-hes-mobilizing-military-to-distribute-potential-coronavirus-vaccine/ar-BB1463uZ}{with
the U.S. military}. Some countries, such as Denmark, have already
created the
\href{https://www.thelocal.dk/20200313/denmark-passes-far-reaching-emergency-coronavirus-law}{legal
basis} for mandatory vaccination of the entire population. In Germany,
too,
\href{https://www.swp.de/panorama/corona-impfpflicht-wird-die-impfung-bald-zur-vorschrift-in-deutschland_-das-ist-der-momentane-stand-45785279.html}{various
politicians} have spoken out in favor of compulsory vaccination.

Proponents of compulsory vaccination, such as World Medical President
Frank Montgomery,
\href{https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Weltaerztepraesident-fordert-Impfpflicht-article21793158.html}{argue}
that the population must be vaccinated to protect those who cannot be
vaccinated for health reasons. In view of the rather
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{low lethality}
of Covid19 and the already wide prevalence, this argumentation seems
rahter questionable, however. In addition, there are the serious vaccine
risks outlined above.

Nevertheless, the head of the largest European \textbf{ticket portal
Eventim}
\href{https://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/audio/Ohne-Impfstoff-keine-Konzerte-article21821926.html}{said}
that ``major events may not return until there is a vaccine or a
correspondingly effective medication.''

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who co-chaired the vaccine summit
in early June with US billionaire Bill Gates, described the GAVI vaccine
alliance as a kind of
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0LAbObZV0}{``health NATO''}.
Nevertheless, ``immunity passports'' are likely to fail since even
antibody tests can only detect
\href{https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/}{about
20\% of all infections}, as the study by Professor Boyman's group has
shown (see above).

\hypertarget{medication-against-covid-19}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Medication against
Covid-19}}{Medication against Covid-19}}\label{medication-against-covid-19}}

The situation regarding helpful medication for severe Covid19 cases
remains very unclear. The only consensus is that blood thinners are
\href{https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200506/blood-thinners-could-boost-covid19-survival}{helpful
in} preventing life-threatening thrombosis and embolism (as with severe
influenza).

There have been fierce discussions about the malaria drug
hydroxychloroquin (HCQ) for months. The journal Lancet published a study
at the end of May according to which HCQ leads to heart problems. The
WHO then ceased all of its HCQ studies. Shortly thereafter, however, it
became known that the Lancet study was based on
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine}{a
manipulated data set}.

The Lancet study and another study in the \emph{New England Journal of
Medicine (NEJM)} had to be
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/researchers-retract-lancet-study-linking-malaria-drug-to-risks}{withdrawn},
which is one of the biggest medical scandals in recent years. The reason
for the manipulated study is not clear, however, the lead author seems
\href{https://www.medicineuncensored.com/a-study-out-of-thin-air}{to be
involved} in a study of competing drug Remdesivir at the same time.

The use of remdesivir by the pharmaceutical company Gilead came itself
under pressure after
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/22/health/remdesivir-covid-19-trial-results-nejm-study/index.html}{a
first study showed} that the drug could not reduce the risk of death.
However, many media ignored this and still reported positive about the
drug.

A former French Minister of Health revealed
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYgiCALEdpE}{in an interview} that
the editors of Lancet and NEJM stated in a confidential discussion panel
that the pressure and influence of pharmaceutical companies had become
so great, indeed ``criminal'', that one could no longer speak of
science.

Various clinics
\href{https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200409/chloroquine-zinc-tested-to-block-covid-infection}{use
or study} HCQ in Covid19 patients, sometimes in combination with zinc,
vitamins or other medications. However, it is known that HCQ can lead to
\href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/13/covid19-a-case-for-medical-detectives/}{fatal
complications} in people from Africa and the Mediterranean region that
have a metabolic pecularity called favism.

Unfortunately, it must be assumed that incorrect or too aggressive
medication with HCQ,
\href{https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206110703.htm}{steroids},
antibiotics and antiviral agents as well as
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/northwell-health-probing-use-of-ventilators-for-covid-patients/}{invasive
ventilation} has led to numerous additional and avoidable deaths during
the corona pandemic.

  explained that} ``all experts are returning to the assessment of the
  early days'' that Covid-19 ``should not be trivialized, but also
  should not be dramatized''. The reason for the declining risk
  assessment was the ``enormous number of infections that remained
  without symptoms''. Streeck does not expect any excess mortality in
  Germany by the end of the year, as the average age of death is
  ``rather above life expectancy'', and he doesn't consider ``corona
  apps'' and widespread corona tests to be useful. He also criticized
  the general use of masks, saying that these are a ``wonderful breeding
  ground for bacteria and fungi''. Schools should be reopened as soon as
  possible.

  An \textbf{employee of the German Ministry of the Interior},
  responsible for disaster protection, together with external experts
  wrote a
  \href{https://www.ichbinanderermeinung.de/Dokument93.pdf}{100-page
  analysis paper} on corona crisis management, which was leaked to the
  press at the beginning of May and created
  \href{https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2020-05/corona-pandemie-bekaempfung-massnahmen-innenministerium-verschwoerungstheorien-regierungsrat/komplettansicht}{strong
  reactions}. In the paper, Covid-19 is described as a \textbf{``global
  false alarm''} because ``there was probably at no time a risk beyond
  the normal level'' for the general population. The collateral damage
  caused by the lockdown is now significantly higher than the
  recognizable benefit and far exceeds the risk potential of the corona
  virus. In March and April alone, over a million operations were not
  carried out in Germany. Crisis management and threat analysis mostly
  failed and data supplied by health authorities were ``inadequate'' as
  the basis for decision-making. The official was subsequently fired
  because he had created the paper ``without authorization''.

  A group led by \textbf{Professor Sucharit Bhakdi founded} the
  Association of \href{https://www.mwgfd.de/}{Physicians and Scientists
  for Health, Freedom and Democracy} (MWGFD), which has already been
  joined by over 16,000 supporters. At the beginning of June, the group
  published a \href{https://www.mwgfd.de/category/topaktuell/}{call to
  the federal government and all state governments} to immediately and
  completely lift the Corona measures. Professor Bhakdi's book,
  \href{https://www.amazon.de/Corona-Fehlalarm-Daten-Fakten-Hintergr\%25C3\%25BCnde/dp/3990601911}{Corona:

  A \textbf{senior physician for intensive medicine at the University
  Hospital Zurich}, who cared for critical Covid 19 patients, criticized
  in a
  \href{https://www.medinside.ch/de/post/corona-intensivmediziner-spricht-klartext}{widely
  shared video} the ``scaremongering'' associated with the disease. For
  the vast majority of all people there is no significant risk of death,
  the numbers are comparable overall to earlier flu waves. Risk groups
  could be protected in a targeted manner, while the lockdown only
  prevents the immunization of the general population. In addition,
  people die due to the medical undersupply in other areas. The medical
  and social damage has long been greater than the benefits. The
  partially mandatory mouth protection for schoolchildren also has ``no
  medical sense and benefit'' and places a heavy burden on the children.
  The ``daily counting'' of the cases is nonsensical and only spreads
  fear. The counterproductive measures must be stopped quickly.Swiss
  media tried
  \href{https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/unispital-distanziert-sich-von-umstrittenen-aussagen-corona-kritiker-feiern-videobotschaft-von-zuercher-oberarzt-id15903859.html}{to

  an article} that Covid19 is a ``very selective disease'' and only
  poses a real risk for very few people. The media, on the other hand,
  focused on the few atypical individual cases that exist with every
  illness. Many scientists had focused too much on their models and too
  little on reality. The planned contact tracing is medically
  ``senseless'' and
  \href{https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/behoerden-und-experten-raetseln-wo-ist-das-virus-hin-id15915001.html}{spreads}

\hypertarget{success-stories}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Success
stories}}{Success stories}}\label{success-stories}}

\textbf{Sweden}: Sweden had no lockdown, no mask requirement and no
primary school closures, but instead mainly relied on the personal
responsibility and cooperation of the population. This approach
\href{https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/05/coronavirus-crisis-sweden-refused-lockdown-other-countries-following/}{worked
well} and Sweden saw only a low mortality rate in the general
population, comparable to a seasonal flu wave.

Nevertheless, the overall mortality rate in Sweden was indeed
\href{https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/}{higher
than} in the neighboring Scandinavian countries or in Germany, which was
portrayed by many international media as an alleged ``failure of the
Swedish no-lockdown strategy''.

However, most media didn't mention that
\href{https://www.thelocal.se/20200525/swedish-death-toll-passes-4000-as-coronavirus-cases-in-care-homes-start-to-fall}{three
quarters of Swedish deaths} occured in nursing facilities, which require
targeted protection and do not benefit from a general lockdown of
society. Indeed, at 86 years, the median age of Swedish Covid deaths is
likely the highest in the world.

The Swedish government has also been one of the few to apologize for the
insufficient protection of nursing patients and to announce an
investigation, but this has again
\href{https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/06/08/no-sweden-has-not-changed-its-mind-about-lockdown/}{been
portrayed} by many media as an alleged ``failure of the Swedish
no-lockdown strategy''.

Yet even total mortality in Sweden remained
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-toll/coronavirus-pushes-swedish-deaths-to-highest-since-1993-in-april-idUSKBN22U1S4}{below
the strongest seasonal flu waves} of the past thirty years. Moreover,
Sweden may now benefit from a very high
\href{https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-stockholm-virus-antibodies-sweden.html}{natural
immunity}, especially in view of the latest immunological studies on the
actual range of antibody tests (see above).

\includegraphics{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/sweden-mortality-comparison-1990-e1591998033581.jpg?w=650\&h=399}

\textbf{Florida}: Despite being home to many senior citizens, Florida
introduced rather few restrictions and even the popular beaches were
reopened early, which was heavily criticized by many US media.
Nevertheless, Florida
\href{https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/}{did
very well} compared to other states and recently had around
\href{https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/03/16/interactive-map-shows-florida-coronavirus-cases-in-real-time/}{2300
deaths in a} population of 21 million, which corresponds to Germany's
low mortality.

In an interview, the governor
\href{https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/05/coronavirus-crisis-ron-desantis-florida-covid-19-strategy/}{explained
that} contrary to the media, he realized early on based on the figures
from South Korea and Italy that Covid19 was only dangerous for a very
small risk group and he therefore protected the nursing homes as best as
possible. In terms of prevention, nursing homes were even more important
than the clinics themselves, and this strategy had proven itself. At the
end of May, the governor announced that summer camps and youth
activities could
\href{https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/florida/articles/2020-05-22/miami-beach-officials-agree-to-reopen-hotels-beaches-june-1}{be
carried out without restrictions}.

\textbf{Japan}: Japan registered some of the first Covid19 cases outside
of China, but did not introduce a lockdown. At the end of March, the
Japan Times asked,
\href{https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/03/20/national/coronavirus-explosion-expected-japan/}{``Where's
the coronavirus explosion?''} Bloomberg now reports that a corona crisis
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-22/did-japan-just-beat-the-virus-without-lockdowns-or-mass-testing}{never
materialized}: there were no restrictions on movement, restaurants and
hairdressers remained open, there were no ``tracking apps'' and no mass
tests of the general population. Nevertheless -- or because of this --
Japan now has by far the least deaths compared to the G7 industrialized
countries.

It is sometimes argued that the respirators were decisive for Japan's
success. However, respirators are voluntary in Japan and did not stop
the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan, while Sweden, Florida and
other successful regions did not use masks in the general population.

\textbf{Belarus}: Belarus has probably implemented the least
restrictions of all industrialized nations and
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZliKGoUN4E}{carried out} even
major events such as the 75-year celebrations of the end of World War
II. Nevertheless, Belarus officially counts fewer than
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Belarus}{300
Covid deaths} even after more than three months. Long-term President
Lukashenko, who has repeatedly referred to Corona as a ``psychosis,''
said in mid-May that the capital, Minsk, had already
\href{https://eng.belta.by/president/view/belarus-president-coronavirus-situation-on-the-mend-130571-2020/}{passed}
the peak. The decision to treat Covid19 cases like normal pneumonia was
correct. Ultimately, however, only statistics on overall mortality will
be able to show whether the Belarusian numbers are really correct.

Many media reported on a study by Imperial College London, according to
which the lockdowns in Europe allegedly
\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52968523}{``saved 3 million
lives''}. In reality, Imperial College London simply compared the
\href{https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/neil-fergusons-imperial-model-could-devastating-software-mistake/}{unrealistic
predictions} of its own model with actual developments. This is
particularly evident in the case of Sweden, which even without a
lockdown had only a fraction of the deaths predicted by the Imperial
College model (see graph).

\includegraphics{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/coronavirus-deaths-in-sweden-actual-deaths-vs-ferguson-projections-may-8-update.png?w=600\&h=470}

\hypertarget{the-role-of-the-media}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{The role of the

Most traditional media, almost all of which are part of
\href{https://swprs.org/the-american-empire-and-its-media/}{elite
geopolitical networks}, decided to run a campaign of fear during the
coronavirus period, a behavior that is usually observed in connection
with
\href{https://www.infosperber.ch/Artikel/Gesundheit/13-irrefuhrende-und-falsche-Behauptungen-zur-Corona-Epidemie}{wars
of}\href{https://swprs.org/the-syria-deception/}{aggression} or alleged
\href{https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/terror-factory-fbi-trevor-aaronson-book/}{terrorist
attacks}.

The risk to the general population was greatly
\href{https://www.infosperber.ch/index.cfm\%3Fgo\%3DArtikel/Gesundheit/13-irrefuhrende-und-falsche-Behauptungen-zur-Corona-Epidemie/\%26g\%3Dad}{exaggerated},
official policies were
\href{https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/186723/1/jarren_corona.pdf}{hardly
questioned}, the situation in hospitals was
\href{https://www.globalresearch.ca/truth-behind-refrigerated-morgue-truck-stories/5711475}{dramatized},
manipulative images were
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/04/01/cbs-admits-to-using-footage-from-italy-in-report-about-nyc/}{used},
campaigns were
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQWRCECbN-Y}{staged}, and
protesters were systematically defamed as ``idiots''.

It is true that some conservative media criticized the economically
harmful lockdown measures. The real question, however, is whether they
will also criticize the surveillance measures now planned, such as the
extensive societal contact tracing (see below).

Most \href{https://swprs.org/media-navigator/}{independent media} sooner
or later realized that the risk of the corona virus was exaggerated and
politically exploited. Only a few independent media outlets did not
realize this, perhaps because they lacked a medical background or fell
for the official campaign of fear.

Some analysts compared Covid-19
\href{https://digwithin.net/2020/06/03/coronavirus-scare/}{to a
psychological operation} that uses the media-induced fear of the virus
to bring about political and social change.

US platforms such as Google, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/youtube-censors-epidemiologist-knut-wittkowski-for-opposing-lockdown/}{censored}
corona issues extensively by deleting critical (i.e. non WHO compliant)
points of view even from doctors or restricting their distribution, a
procedure that has long been the norm for geopolitical issues.

However, modern media users have the option of using manipulation-free
search engines such as DuckDuckGo and independent video platforms such
as Bitchute, as well as generally using an advertising and tracking
blocker on certain media sites.

\hypertarget{political-developments}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Political

Numerous observers have already drawn attention to the fact that the
predominantly politically induced ``corona crisis'' is or could be
instrumentalized for far-reaching social and economic changes.

In March, NSA whistleblower \textbf{Edward Snowden} warned that
governments are using the temporary corona crisis as an occasion or
pretext for the permanent expansion of
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcQFTzck_c}{social surveillance
and control}, thereby establishing an ``architecture of oppression''.

The measures currently being discussed or already implemented include in
particular:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The introduction of applications for \textbf{society-wide}
  \textbf{contact tracing}
\item
  Building \textbf{units to enforce} tracing and isolation of citizens
\item
  The introduction of digital \textbf{biometric ID cards} that can be
  used to control and regulate participation in social and professional
  activities.
\item
  The expanded control of \textbf{travel and payment transactions} (e.g.
  cash abolition).
\item
  The creation of legal foundations for access to the \textbf{biological
  systems} of citizens by governments or corporations (through so-called
  ``mandatory vaccinations'').
\end{enumerate}

More than 600 scientists
\href{https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/sites/contact-tracing-joint-statement/}{have
warned of} an ``unprecedented surveillance of society'' through
problematic apps for ``contact tracing''. In some countries, such
``contact tracing'' is already carried out directly
\href{https://www.jewishpress.com/news/the-courts/state-to-high-court-even-more-shin-bet-involvement-in-fighting-the-coronavirus/2020/04/14/}{by
the secret service}. In several parts of the world, the population is
already being
\href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/04/25/50-headlines-darker-more-of-the-new-normal/}{monitored
by drones} and facing serious police overreach.

In May, \textbf{Apple and Google added} a contact tracing interface to
the operating systems of
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/apple-google-bring-covid-19-contact-tracing-to-3-billion-people}{three
billion cell phones} that can now be used by national authorities.

This is despite the fact that a recent WHO study on pandemic influenza
came to the conclusion that contact tracing is not sensible from a
medical point of view and is
\href{https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf}{``not
recommended in any circumstances''}, as the epidemiological benefits of
such apps remain doubtful.

It is often argued that the contact tracing applications would remain
``voluntary'' and ``compliant with data protection''. However, in
practice, neither is really true.

In several countries, the use of the applications is already mandatory
for certain activities. Various employers, administrations, landlords
and transport companies in \textbf{India} require
\href{https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1001360/india-aarogya-setu-covid-app-mandatory/}{the
tracing app}. In \textbf{Argentina}, everyone who is in the ``public
space'' must
\href{https://www.heise.de/tp/features/CuidAR-Argentinien-ueberwacht-mit-einer-App-4720143.html}{activate
contact tracing}.

Some \textbf{German politicians} already advocated a
\href{https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/wer-die-corona-app-hat-soll-zuerst-wieder-ins-restaurant-duerfen-16759932.html}{preference
for app users} when traveling or dining out. The \textbf{Israeli Prime
Minister} Netanyahu, for his part, spoke of the
\href{https://norberthaering.de/die-regenten-der-welt/netanyahu-sensoren/}{use
of ``sensors''} for distance control in children.

In \textbf{Singapore}, the ``voluntary'' app was installed by fewer
people than expected, which is why the government now wants to make it
\href{https://www.letemps.ch/economie/singapour-tracage-app-degenere-surveillance-masse}{mandatory}
for certain public spaces and services. In some parks, the distance
control is already
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DJmIjKtVkA}{monitored by DARPA
robots}.

In \textbf{Australia}, people who do not want to use the contact tracing
app are insulted by the media
\href{https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/australia/people-who-refuse-to-download-the-covidsafe-virus-tracing-app-are-the-new-antivaxxers/news-story/541c36fe5cdb56eb1a098b0b9a0dddcc}{as
idiots and a danger to the public}, and are thus put under social
pressure.

The \textbf{data protection of} the supposedly ``decentralized'' contact
tracing is also problematic. The Dutch IT professor Jaap-Henk Hoepmann
\href{http://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/11/stop-the-apple-and-google-contact-tracing-platform-or-be-ready-to-ditch-your-smartphone/}{already
explained in April} that even supposedly decentralized solutions can
very easily be used for monitoring and surveillance.

Due to the speed of the introduction, the President of the German
Society for Computer Science suspected that the functions
\href{https://www.heise.de/news/Informatiker-Die-Corona-App-ist-wie-ein-trojanisches-Pferd-4764560.html}{``had
long been in the devices''} and only a little ``fine tuning'' was
required. He sees the apps as a \textbf{``Trojan horse''}.

In parallel to the introduction of the applications, many countries have
started to set up \textbf{special units to track contacts and isolate
citizens}.

In the \textbf{United States} a
\href{https://heavy.com/news/2020/05/hr-6666-trace-bill-bobby-rush/}{100
billion-dollar legislation} to set up a national ``Corona testing and
tracing corps'' with up to
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/29/corona-corps-could-fight-virus-youth-unemployment/}{180,000
members} has been proposed. The states of
\href{https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/johns-hopkins-and-bloomberg-philanthropies-with-new-york-state-launch-online-course-to-train-army-of-contact-tracers-to-slow-spread-of-COVID-19.html}{New
York} and
\href{https://timesofsandiego.com/tech/2020/05/06/california-training-a-20000-person-army-of-coronavirus-tracers/}{California}
are already building ``contact tracing armies'' with up to 20,000
members each. In the state of
\href{https://lynnwoodtimes.com/2020/05/12/governor-inslee-lays-out-statewide-contact-tracing-plan-for-covid-19/}{Washington},
the National Guard is to participate and those who do not cooperate
``voluntarily'' can be forced to do so.

\textbf{Italy has} announced the creation of a corps
\href{https://www.thelocal.it/20200525/italy-seeks-60000-volunteers-to-enforce-coronavirus-rules}{with
60,000 volunteers}, and
\href{https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/coronavirus-in-zuerich-contact-tracing-ist-gut-angelaufen-ld.1556846}{Switzerland}
and other countries have also started building such units. In
\textbf{Germany} there have already been mass tests in residential
buildings under the threat of
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZQFpnskP8g}{police coercion}.

The \textbf{software} for society-wide contact tracing in the USA,

\href{https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/palantir-coronavirus-cdc-nhs-gotham-foundry/}{CIA-related

used}.

A \textbf{whistleblower} who
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUyZWw7qoc}{took part} in a
training program for contact tracers in the United States described it
in a video interview as ``totalitarian'' and a ``danger to society''.

All these measures are taken despite the fact that the epidemiological
benefit remains unclear and that the WHO
\href{https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf}{explicitly
opposed} contact tracing, which is otherwise used mainly for serious
sexual diseases or food poisoning, which, unlike common respiratory
diseases, are easy to trace.

In addition to applications and special units for contact tracing, there
are also specific
\href{https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/the-uk-government-is-in-talks-with-facial-recognition-firms-to-develop-covid-19-immunity-passports/ar-BB12J6It}{projects
or plans} for \textbf{``immunity cards''}, which could be used, for
example, to control the travel and work activities of the population. In
fact, the EU
\href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/22/report-eu-planning-vaccination-passport-since-2018/}{had
been} planning to introduce such a vaccination certificate
\href{https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/22/report-eu-planning-vaccination-passport-since-2018/}{since
2018}.

Such ``vaccination cards'' are in turn linked to a worldwide
\textbf{``vaccination program''}, which is also currently being worked
on. For example, US billionaire and vaccine investor Bill Gates called
for corona vaccination for
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-14-billion-doses-coronavirus-vaccine-may-be-needed-2020-5}{``seven
billion people''}. AstraZeneca is currently preparing to produce
\href{https://www.sciencealert.com/2-billion-doses-of-oxford-s-potential-coronavirus-vaccine-could-soon-become-available}{two
billion doses of} the still untested Oxford vaccine.

From a strategic point of view, such a global vaccination programme
would provide access to the biological systems of the population, in
particular the immune and nervous systems and the genetic and
reproductive systems.

In the \textbf{economic area}, there is a surge in digitization and
centralization in favor of a few US technology corporations, as the
\emph{American} \emph{National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence (NSCAI)}, led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt,
\href{http://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/05/reports/techno-tyranny-how-the-us-national-security-state-is-using-coronavirus-to-fulfill-an-orwellian-vision/}{demanded
in a strategy paper} in 2019 to be able to compete with China.\\

The \textbf{World Economic Forum (WEF)} Davos, which together with the
Gates Foundation and Johns Hopkins University already ran the well-known
\href{https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/scenario.html}{coronavirus
pandemic exercise ``Event 201''} in October 2019, called for a global
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5pxhSnDr4U}{``Great Reset''} in
order prepare the economic and social structures for the 21st century.

Meanwhile, several cardinals and bishops of the \textbf{Catholic Church}
warned in an \href{https://veritasliberabitvos.info/appeal/}{open
letter} that, under the pretext of the coronavirus, a worldwide panic
had been triggered to introduce ``unacceptable forms of global
surveillance and control'' of the population.

The idea that a pandemic can be used to expand global monitoring and
control is not new. As early as 2010 the American \textbf{Rockefeller
Foundation} described in a
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rockefeller-foundation-scenarios-2010.pdf}{working
paper on future technological and social developments} a ``lockstep
scenario'' in which the present-day developments were anticipated with
surprising accuracy (from page 18).

But there are also reactions from the population:
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZo3BYD2qpI}{Spain},
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2Tcs8RzK1k}{Italy} and
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqm456JIaBQ}{Germany}, for
example, have seen demonstrations for fundamental rights with thousands
or tens of thousands of people.

  After about four weeks of relative excess mortality, since the middle

  is around 84 years, which is slightly \emph{above} the average Swiss
  life expectancy.
\item
  There were a total of 130 test-positive deaths in the \textbf{Canton
  of Zurich}. More than half of this (78) took place in nursing homes.
  Again slightly more than half of these deaths (40) took place

  before the \textbf{lockdown}, in order not to openly contradict to the
  Federal Council. But the result
  \href{https://infekt.ch/2020/04/sind-wir-tatsaechlich-im-blindflug/}{remains
  the same}: the lockdown was medically unnecessary and socially
  counterproductive. The forecasts of the authorities and universities

  vaccine. An independent analysis of this study, however, showed that
  it is based on
  \href{https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Fellay-Studie-Zweite-Corona-Welle-4726303.html}{completely

  \href{https://www.insidecorona.ch/2020/05/21/coronakrise-professionelles-krisenmanagement-sieht-anders-aus/}{a
  devastating conclusion} with regard to the Corona management of the
  Federal Council. The Federal Council largely ignored the findings of
  its own pandemic commission and made grotesquely wrong decisions with
  serious consequences for the population and the economy. An unsuitable
  ``containment strategy'' was pursued in the naive belief that the time
  until a vaccine could be ``bridged''. The planned ``contact tracing''
  will consume tons of money and ultimately ``fail miserably''. It is
  high time to abolish the emergency laws and hold the decision-makers
  accountable, according to Rietiker.

  experience of March and April had shown that the center would have to
  be expanded or outsourced in the future.

  A survey by the University of Applied Sciences ZHAW showed that
  \href{https://www.zhaw.ch/de/medien/medienmitteilungen/detailansicht-medienmitteilung/event-news/viele-schweizer-fuerchten-ueberwachung-durch-contact-tracing-app/}{40\%

  Still, a majority plan to use the contact tracing app.

  In February 2020, US billionaire and vaccine investor Bill Gates

  The \textbf{Corona-critical doctor from Aargau}, who was brutally
  arrested in April by a special police unit and temporarily admitted to
  the psychiatric center, requested an

  administrative investigation} into his case, which the government has
  now initiated. It was previously known that, contrary to what the
  police had said, the doctor neither threatened relatives nor the
  authorities nor was he in possession of a loaded weapon.

  Germany and Austria have \textbf{not had any significant excess
  mortality} since March. In fact, Germany has even seen
  \href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/breyer-deutschland-untersterblichkeit.pdf}{a

  protocols} in Austria, as in Denmark and England, have shown that the
  \textbf{lockdown was politically motivated} and the majority of the
  health experts spoke out against it, recommending to Chancellor Kurz
  in March to get away from the message of a ``very dangerous virus''
  because the virus was already widespread and not particularly
  dangerous for the majority of the population.

  In Germany,

  by the end of May. German oncologists
  \href{https://deutsch.medscape.com/artikelansicht/4908889}{warn of

  \textbf{``corona suicides''} from people who fear or think they may be
  infected. Professor Tsokos criticized the scaremongering and spread of
  ``horror scenarios'' by the media and some virologists. He fears that
  the ``infectious pandemic'' will now be followed by a ``psycho-social
  pandemic''. In fact, suicides and suicide attempts in Berlin already

  Since April some of the largest \textbf{fundamental rights
  demonstrations in} Europe have taken place in German cities with up to
  25,000 participants. However, there was sometimes serious police
  violence, for example when arresting vegan celebrity chef

  68-year-old former GDR civil rights activist
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCbgVFRCnTc}{Angelika Barbe}.
  There were also
  \href{https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden-wuerttemberg/spreng-anschlag-100.html}{arson
  attacks} and, in some cases, life-threatening
  \href{https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden-wuerttemberg/stuttgart/corona-demo-in-stuttgart-ermittlungen-wegen-versuchter-toetung-100.html}{attacks}
  on demonstrators and independent

  of state persecution.

  \textbf{Werner Winterstein}, the grandson of an Austrian-Jewish
  Minister of Justice murdered by the Nazis, took part in a fundamental
  rights demonstration in Vienna \href{https://vimeo.com/418039066}{and
  declared} that he was ``shaken by the silent seizure of power by
  elements that speak of `new normality' on the margins of the
  democratic model. '' The corona-related division of citizens into
  different categories and the creation of a new ``snitch culture'' are
  dangerous developments. He observed a lack of civil courage and
  submission to the authorities. The planned Corona apps are a move
  ``towards a total surveillance state'' and should be rejected.

After the spread of corona in Europe and the United States subsided,
many media focused on the situation in South America, especially in
\textbf{Brazil}. However, in comparison, the fact is that Brazil with
its 210 million inhabitants is still much
\href{https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/}{better
off} than many European countries.

In other Latin American countries such as \textbf{Ecuador}, in addition
to the coronavirus,
\href{https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-52383340}{dengue
fever also} spreads with similar symptoms, which has lead to a double
burden on the health system. Nevertheless, in \textbf{Peru} it was found
that 80\% of confirmed corona cases
\href{https://exitosanoticias.pe/v1/covid-19-minsa-el-80-de-casos-confirmados-en-el-peru-son-asintomaticos/}{remain
asymptomatic}.

Some media reported crematoriums running allegedly ``around the clock''
in \textbf{Mexico City}. A Youtuber living in Mexico
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQhwEZpDPE}{then visited} the
city and the hospitals, funeral homes and crematoriums there, all of
which had very little activity.

In general, there has been a
\href{https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/coronavirus-why-africa-seems-to-have-few-cases/ar-BB10MNJd}{much
lower corona mortality rate} in countries in South America and Africa
than in Europe and the USA, which may be due to the younger population
or climatic factors. On the other hand, the World Bank expects up to
\href{https://www.deccanherald.com/business/economy-business/world-bank-says-covid-19-to-push-60-million-into-poverty-announces-usd-160-billion-assistance-to-100-countries-839661.html}{60
million victims of poverty} due to global political corona measures.
