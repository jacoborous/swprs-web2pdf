An overview of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of face
masks.

\hypertarget{1-studies-on-the-effectiveness-of-face-masks}{%
\paragraph{1. Studies on the effectiveness of face
masks}\label{1-studies-on-the-effectiveness-of-face-masks}}

So far, most studies found little to no evidence for the effectiveness
of cloth face masks in the general population, neither as personal
protective equipment nor as a source control.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A May 2020
  \href{https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article}{meta-study
  on pandemic influenza} published by the US CDC found that face masks
  had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a
  source control.
\item
  A
  \href{https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/}{July
  2020 review} by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medince found
  that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against
  virus infection or transmission.
\item
  A Covid-19
  \href{https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown}{cross-country
  study} by the University of East Anglia came to the conclusion that a
  mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of
  infection.
\item
  An
  \href{https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data}{April
  2020 review} by two US professors in respiratory and infectious
  disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have
  no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect
  third parties (so-called source control).
\item
  An article in the \emph{New England Journal of Medicine} from May 2020
  came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer
  \href{https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372}{little to no
  protection} in everyday life.
\item
  A \href{http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13523664}{July 2020 study}
  by Japanese researchers found that cloth masks ``offer zero protection
  against coronavirus'' due to their large pore size and generally poor
  fit.
\item
  A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open
  \href{https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577}{found that} cloth
  masks were penetrated by 97\% of particles and may increase infection
  risk by retaining moisture or repeated use.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{additional-aspects}{%
\subparagraph{Additional aspects:}\label{additional-aspects}}

\textbf{Japan}, despite its widespread use of face masks, experienced
its
\href{https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/}{most
recent influenza epidemic} with more than 5 million people falling ill
just one year ago, in January and February 2019. However, unlike SARS-2,
the influenza virus is transmitted by children, too.

Several countries and states that introduced mandatory face masks on
\textbf{public transport and in shops} in early summer, such as
\href{https://covidusa.net/?state=California}{California} and
\href{https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/argentina/}{Argentinia},
nevertheless saw a strong increase in infections from July onwards,
indicating a low effectiveness of mask policies.

There
is\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768396}{increasing
evidence} that SARS-2 is transmitted, at least indoors, not only by
droplets but also by smaller \textbf{aerosols}. However, due to their
large pore size, cloth masks cannot filter out aerosols.

The \textbf{WHO} admitted to the BBC that its June 2020
\href{https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200608/who-changes-stance-says-public-should-wear-masks}{mask
policy update} was due not to new evidence but
\href{https://twitter.com/ClarkeMicah/status/1282987860090593280}{``political
lobbying''}: ``We had been told by various sources WHO committee
reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them
due to political lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.''
(Deborah Cohen, BBC Medical Corresponent).

\hypertarget{2-studies-claiming-face-masks-are-effective}{%
\paragraph{2. Studies claiming face masks are
effective}\label{2-studies-claiming-face-masks-are-effective}}

Some recent studies argued that cloth face masks are indeed effective
against the new coronavirus and could at least prevent the infection of
other people. However, most of these studies suffer from poor
methodology and sometimes show the opposite of what they claim.

Typically, these studies ignore the effect of other measures, the
natural development of infection numbers, changes in test activity, or
they compare countries with very different conditions.

An overview:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A German study \href{http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf\#page=28}{claimed
  that} the introduction of compulsory masks in German cities had led to
  a decrease in infections. But the data does not support this: in some
  cities there was no change, in others a decrease, in others an
  increase in infections (see graph below). The city of Jena was an
  `exception' only because it simultaneously introduced the
  \href{https://www.mdr.de/thueringen/ost-thueringen/jena/corona-jena-seit-einer-woche-keine-neuinfektion-100.html}{strictest
  quarantine rules} in Germany, but the study did not mention this.
\item
  A study in the journal PNAS
  \href{https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857}{claimed that} masks
  had led to a decrease in infections in three hotspots (including New
  York City). This did not take into account the natural decrease in
  infections and other measures. The study was so flawed that over 40
  scientists recommended that the study
  \href{https://reason.com/2020/06/22/prominent-researchers-say-a-widely-cited-study-on-wearing-masks-is-badly-flawed/}{be
  withdrawn}.
\item
  A US study
  \href{https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818}{claimed
  that} mandatory masks had led to a decrease in infections in 15
  states. The study did not take into account that the incidence of
  infection was already declining in most states at that time. A
  comparison with other states was not made.
\item
  A Canadian study
  \href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231v3.full.pdf}{claimed
  that} countries with mandatory masks had fewer deaths than countries
  without mandatory masks. But the study compared African, Latin
  American, Asian and Eastern European countries with very different
  infection rates and population structures.
\item
  A much-cited meta-study in the journal \emph{Lancet}
  \href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext}{claimed
  that} masks ``could'' lead to a reduction in the risk of infection,
  but the studies considered mainly hospitals (Sars-1), medical (not
  cloth) masks, and the strength of the evidence was reported as
  ``low''.
\end{enumerate}

Wearing masks for a prolonged period of time is not harmless, as the
following evidence shows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  The WHO warns of various
  \href{https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak}{``side
  effects''} such as difficulty breathing and skin rashes.
\item
  Tests conducted by the University Hospital of Leipzig in Germany
  \href{https://science.orf.at/stories/3201213/}{have shown that} face
  masks significantly reduce the resilience and performance of healthy
  persons.
\item
  A German psychological study with about 1000 participants found
  \href{https://corona-transition.org/der-maskenzwang-ist-verantwortlich-fur-schwere-psychische-schaden-und-die}{``severe
  psychosocial consequences''} due to the introduction of mandatory face
  masks in Germany.
\item
  The Hamburg Environmental Institute warned against the
  \href{https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht}{inhalation
  of chlorine compounds} in polyester masks as well as problems in
  connection with disposal.
\item
  The European rapid alert system RAPEX has already
  \href{https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht}{recalled
  70 mask models} because they did not meet EU quality standards and
  could lead to ``serious risks''.
\item
  In China, two boys who had to wear a mask during sports classes
  \href{https://www.ibtimes.com/2-chinese-boys-wearing-masks-during-gym-class-dropped-dead-reports-say-2971556}{fainted
  and died}.
\item
  In the US, a car driver wearing an N95 (FFP2) mask
  \href{https://nypost.com/2020/04/24/driver-crashes-car-after-passing-out-from-wearing-n95-mask/}{fainted
  and died} in an accident.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\paragraph{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Cloth face masks in the general population might be effective, at least
in some circumstances, but there is currently little to no evidence
supporting this proposition. If the SARS-2 virus is indeed transmitted
via aerosols, at least indoors, cloth masks are unlikely to be
protective.
