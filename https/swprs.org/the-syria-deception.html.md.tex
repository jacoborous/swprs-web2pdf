\textbf{Understanding the geopolitical and psychological war against
Syria.}

What is the Syria war about?

Contrary to the depiction in Western media, the Syria war is not a civil
war. This is because the initiators, financiers and a large part of the
anti-government
fighters~\href{https://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-its-not-a-civil-war-and-it-never-was/5498602}{come
from abroad}.

Nor is the Syria war a religious war, for Syria was and still is one of
the most
\href{https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/stop-trying-to-make-syrias-war-into-a-sectarian-conflict/274060/}{secular
countries} in the region, and the Syrian army -- like its direct
opponents -- is itself mainly composed of Sunnis.

But the Syria war is also not a pipeline war, as some critics suspected,
\href{https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/pipelineistan-conspiracy-war-syria-has-never-been-about-gas}{because}
the allegedly competing gas pipeline projects
\href{https://truthout.org/articles/the-war-against-the-assad-regime-is-not-a-pipeline-war/}{never
existed} to begin with, as even the Syrian president
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flaqLAp0Yp4\&t=1674}{confirmed}.

Instead, the Syria war is a
\href{https://swprs.org/us-foreign-policy/}{war of conquest and regime
change}, which developed into a geopolitical proxy war between NATO
states on one side -- especially the US, Great Britain and France -- and
Russia, Iran, and China on the other side.

In fact, already since the 1940s the US has repeatedly
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Syria}{attempted}
to install a pro-Western government in Syria, such as in 1949, 1956,
1957, after 1980 and after 2003, but without success so far. This makes
Syria -- since the fall of Libya -- the
\href{https://www.nato.int/cps/ua/natohq/topics_81136.htm}{last}
Mediterranean country independent of NATO.

Thus, in the course of the ``Arab Spring'' of 2011, NATO and its allies,
especially Israel and the Gulf States,
\href{https://www.globalresearch.ca/former-french-foreign-minister-the-war-against-syria-was-planned-two-years-before-the-arab-spring/5339112}{decided}
to try again. To this end, politically and economically motivated
protests in Syria were leveraged and were quickly
\href{https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-dirty-war-on-syria/5491859}{escalated}
into an armed conflict.

NATO's original strategy of 2011 was based on
the\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone}{Afghanistan
war} of the 1980s and aimed at conquering Syria mainly through
\emph{positively portrayed} Islamist militias (so-called ``rebels'').
This did not succeed, however, because the militias lacked an air force
and anti-aircraft missiles.

Hence from 2013 onwards,
\href{https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/ex-weapons-inspector-trumps-sarin-claims-built-on-lie/}{various}
poison gas
\href{https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-bbc-saving-syrias-children-documentary-staged-events-fake-video-footage/5470158}{attacks}
were
\href{https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7793253/PETER-HITCHENS-reveals-evidence-watchdog-suppressed-report-casting-doubt-Assad-gas-attack.html}{staged}
in order to be able to deploy the NATO air force as part of a
``humanitarian intervention'' similar to the earlier wars against Libya
and Yugoslavia. But this did not succeed either, mainly because Russia
and China blocked a UN mandate.

As of 2014, therefore, additional but \emph{negatively portrayed}
Islamist militias (``terrorists'') were covertly
\href{https://www.globalresearch.ca/logistics-101-where-does-isis-get-its-guns/5454726}{established}
in Syria and Iraq via NATO partners Turkey and Jordan, secretly
\href{https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/isil-weapons-traced-saudi-arabia-171214164431586.html}{supplied}
with weapons and
\href{https://journal-neo.org/2015/10/09/the-mystery-of-isis-toyota-army-solved/}{vehicles}
and indirectly
\href{https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-27/how-turkey-exports-isis-oil-world-scientific-evidence}{financed}
by oil exports via the Turkish Ceyhan terminal.

\includegraphics{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/isis-control-2015-isw-atlantic.jpg?w=600\&h=443}

Media-effective
\href{https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/bill-gardner/11054488/Foley-murder-video-may-have-been-staged.html}{atrocity
propaganda} and mysterious ``terrorist attacks'' in Europe and the US
then offered the opportunity to intervene in Syria using the NATO air
force even \emph{without} a UN mandate -- ostensibly to fight the
``terrorists'', but
\href{https://mondoweiss.net/2017/01/watched-manage-leaked/}{in reality}
still to conquer Syria and topple its government.

This plan failed again, however, as Russia \emph{also} used the presence
of the ``terrorists'' in autumn 2015 as a justification for direct
military
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War}{intervention}
and was now able to attack both the ``terrorists'' \emph{and} parts of
NATO's ``rebels'' while simultaneously securing the Syrian airspace to a
large extent.

By the end of 2016, the Syrian army thus succeeded in
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aleppo_(2012\%E2\%80\%932016)}{recapturing}
the city of Aleppo.

From 2016 onwards, NATO therefore switched back to positively portrayed
but now \emph{Kurdish-led}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Democratic_Forces}{militias}~
(the SDF) in order to still have unassailable ground forces available
and to conquer the Syrian territory held by the previously established
``terrorists'' before Syria and Russia could do so themselves.

This led to a kind of
\href{https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/03/23/the-noose-is-tightening-in-syria}{``race''}
to conquer cities such as Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor in 2017 and to a
temporary division of Syria along the Euphrates river into a (largely)
Syrian-controlled West and a Kurdish (or rather American) controlled
East (see map below).

This move, however, brought NATO into
\href{https://www.dw.com/en/nato-allies-clash-as-turkey-attacks-us-backed-kurds-in-syria/a-42262543}{conflict}
with its key member Turkey, because Turkey did not accept a
Kurdish-controlled territory on its southern border. As a result, the
NATO alliance became increasingly divided from 2018 onwards.

Turkey now
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_occupation_of_northern_Syria}{fought}
the Kurds in northern Syria and at the same time supported the remaining
Islamists in the north-western province of Idlib against the Syrian
army, while the Americans eventually
\href{https://www.france24.com/en/20191026-after-abandoning-kurds-us-to-send-troops-to-syria-oil-fields}{withdrew}
to the eastern Syrian oil fields in order to retain a political
bargaining chip.

While Turkey supported Islamists in northern Syria, Israel more or less
covertly
\href{https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Israel-treating-al-Qaida-fighters-wounded-in-Syria-civil-war-393862}{supplied}
Islamists in southern Syria and at the same time fought Iranian and
Lebanese (Hezbollah) units with cross-border air strikes, though without
lasting success: the militias in southern Syria had to surrender in
2018.

Ultimately, some NATO members
\href{https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-syria-security-turkey-usa/us-condemns-idlib-assaults-stands-by-turkey-secretary-of-state-pompeo-idUKKBN1ZY2FH}{tried}
to use a confrontation between the Turkish and Syrian armies in the
province of Idlib as a last option to escalate the war. In addition to
the situation in Idlib, the issues of the occupied territories in the
north and east of Syria remain to be resolved, too.

Russia, for its part, has tried to draw Turkey out of the NATO alliance
and onto its own side as far as possible. Modern Turkey, however, is
pursuing a rather far-reaching geopolitical
\href{https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/23/turkeys-religious-nationalists-want-ottoman-borders-iraq-erdogan/}{strategy}
of its own, which is also increasingly clashing with Russian interests
in the Middle East and Central Asia.

As part of this geopolitical strategy, Turkey in 2015 and 2020 twice
used the so-called
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_as_weapons}{»weapon of mass
migration«}, which may serve to destabilize both Syria (so-called
\href{https://www.rt.com/news/319797-syria-depopulation-refugees-assange/}{strategic
depopulation}) and Europe, as well as to extort financial, political or
military support from the European Union.

\includegraphics{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/syria-map-2020.jpg?w=550\&h=537}

What role did the Western media play in this war?

The task of
\href{https://swprs.org/the-american-empire-and-its-media/}{NATO-compliant}
media was to portray the war against Syria as a ``civil war'', the
Islamist ``rebels'' positively, the Islamist ``terrorists'' and the
Syrian government negatively, the alleged ``poison gas attacks''
credibly and the NATO intervention consequently as legitimate.

An important tool for this media strategy were the numerous
Western-sponsored
\href{https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/revealed-british-government-covert-propaganda-campaign-syria}{``media
centres''},
\href{https://www.unz.com/pgiraldi/the-fraud-of-the-white-helmets/}{``activist
groups''},
\href{https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/twitter-executive-also-part-time-officer-uk-army-psychological-warfare-unit}{``Twitter
girls''},
\href{https://thegrayzone.com/2018/06/06/syrian-observatory-for-human-rights-funding-sohr-uk-government/}{``human
rights observatories''} and the like, which provided Western news
agencies and media with the desired images and information.

Since 2019, NATO-compliant media moreover had to conceal or discredit
various leaks and whistleblowers that began to prove the covert Western
\href{https://armswatch.com/350-diplomatic-flights-carry-weapons-for-terrorists/}{arms
deliveries} to the Islamist ``rebels'' and ``terrorists'' as well as the
staged
\href{https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/11/new-leaks-shatter-opcws-attacks-douma-whistleblowers/}{``poison
gas attacks''}.

But if even the ``terrorists'' in Syria were demonstrably established
and equipped by NATO states, what role then did the mysterious ``caliph
of terror'' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi play? He possibly played a role similar
to that of his direct
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Omar_al-Baghdadi}{predecessor},
Omar al-Baghdadi -- who was a nonexistent
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/world/africa/18iht-iraq.4.6718200.html}{phantom}.

Thanks to new communication technologies and on-site sources, the Syria
war was also the first war about which
\href{https://swprs.org/media-navigator/}{independent media} could
report almost in real-time and thus for the first time significantly
influenced the public perception of events -- a potentially historic
change.
