  Stanford professor \textbf{John Ioannidis} explains
  \href{https://twitter.com/cnn/status/1256579248342564865}{in an
  interview with CNN} that Covid19 is a ``widespread and mild disease''
  comparable to influenza (flu) for the general population, while
  patients in nursing homes and hospitals should receive extra
  protection.
\item
  Stanford professor \textbf{Scott Atlas} explains
  \href{https://www.facebook.com/cnn/posts/10160799274796509}{in an
  interview with CNN} that ``the idea of having to stop Covid19 has
  created a catastrophic health care situation''. Professor Atlas says
  that the disease is ``generally mild'' and that irrational fears had
  been created. He adds that there is ``absolutely no reason'' for
  extensive testing in the general population, which is only necessary
  in hospitals and nursing homes. Professor Atlas wrote an article at
  the end of April
  entitled\href{https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/494034-the-data-are-in-stop-the-panic-and-end-the-total-isolation}{``The
  data are in -- Stop the panic and end total isolation''} that received
  over 15,000 comments.
\item
  Epidemiologist \textbf{Dr Knut Wittkowski}
  \href{https://www.thepressandthepublic.com/post/perspectives-on-the-pandemic-v}{explains
  in a new interview} that the danger of Covid19 is comparable to an
  influenza and that the peak was already passed in most countries
  before the lockdown. The lockdown of entire societies was a
  ``catastrophic decision'' without benefits but causing enormous
  damage. The most important measure is the protection of nursing homes.
  According to Dr. Wittkowski, Bill Gates' statements on Covid19 are
  ``absurd'' and ``have nothing to do with reality''. Dr. Wittkowski
  considers a vaccination against Covid19 ``not necessary'' and the
  influential Covid19 model of British epidemiologist Neil Ferguson a
  ``complete failure''. (\textbf{Note}: The video was removed by
  Youtube).
\item
  German virologist \textbf{Hendrik Streeck}
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrL9QKGQrWk}{explains the final
  results} of his pioneering antibody study. Professor Streeck found a
  Covid19 lethality of 0.36\%, but explains that this is an upper limit
  and the lethality is probably in the range of 0.24 to 0.26\% or even
  below. The average age of test-positive deceased was approximately 81
  years. Professor Streeck argues that ``waiting for a vaccine'' is not
  a good strategy because both the feasibility and effectiveness of a
  vaccine are uncertain.
\item
  Biology professor and Nobel Prize winner \textbf{Michael Levitt}, who
  has been analyzing the spread of Covid19 since February, describes the
  general lockdown as
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl-sZdfLcEk}{a „huge mistake``}
  and calls for more targeted measures, especially to protect risk
  groups.
\item
  The emeritus microbiology professor \textbf{Sucharit Bhakdi} explains
  \href{https://www.servustv.com/videos/aa-23zjmvcz51w12/}{in a new
  interview} that politics and the media have been conducting an
  ``intolerable fear-mongering'' and an ``irres­pon­sible disinformation
  campaign''. According to professor Bhakdi, face masks for the general
  population are not needed and may in fact be harmful ``germ
  catchers''. The current crisis was brought about by the politicians
  themselves and has little to do with the virus, he argues, while a
  vaccine against coronavirus is ``unnecessary and dangerous'', as was
  already the case with swine flu. The WHO has ``never taken
  responsibility for its many wrong decisions over the years'',
  professor Bhakdi adds. (\textbf{Note}: The video was temporarily
  deleted by YouTube).
\item
  The Swiss chief physician for infectiology, \textbf{Dr. Pietro
  Vernazza}, explains
  \href{https://www.saldo.ch/artikel/artikeldetail/fuer-die-allermeisten-menschen-verlaeuft-die-erkrankung-mild/}{in
  a new interview} that the Covid19 disease is ``mild for the vast
  majority of people'' and the ``counting of infected people and the
  call for more tests'' aren't helpful. In addition, most of the people
  listed in the corona statistics did not die solely from Covid-19.
  According to Dr. Vernazza, there is no evidence for the benefit of
  face masks in people who do not show symptoms themselves
  (\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/saldo-interview-pietro-vernazza-14-04-2020.pdf}{archive}).

  A \href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{new overview
  of existing PCR and antibody studies} shows that the median value of
  Covid19 lethality (IFR) is about 0.2\% and thus in the range of a
  strong influenza.

  countries by Covid19, also showed a very low lethality of 0.08\% to
  0.12\%.
\item
  A new
  \href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20079822v1}{antibody
  study from Japan} comes to the conclusion that about 400 to 800 times
  more people there had contact with the new coronavirus than previously
  thought, but showed no or hardly any symptoms. Japan had done rather
  few tests so far.
\item
  A
  \href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20061440v1}{new
  study from Germany}, with the participation of leading virologist
  Christian Drosten, shows that about one third of the population
  already has some \textbf{cellular immunity} to the Covid19 corona
  virus, presumably through contact with earlier corona viruses (cold
  viruses). This cellular immunity by so-called T-cells is significantly
  higher than PCR and antibody tests suggested and may partly explain
  why many people develop no symptoms with the new coronavirus.
\item
  In a prison in the US state of Tennessee, only two out of 1349
  test-positive people

  On the French \textbf{aircraft carrier} Charles de Gaulle,
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_on_Charles_de_Gaulle}{none}

  carrier Theodore Roosevelt,
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_on_USS_Theodore_Roosevelt}{one}
  of 969 test-positive sailors has died so far (preconditions and exact
  cause of death are not known). This yields a lethality rate of 0 to
  0.1\% for this population group.

  Numerous media reported about alleged \textbf{``re-infections''} of
  already recovered persons in South Korea. However, researchers have
  now
  \href{https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-patients-infected-twice-test-a9491986.html}{come
  to the conclusion} that all of the 290 suspected cases were
  \emph{false-positive test results} caused by ``non-infectious virus
  fragments''. The result again highlights the
  \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219885}{well-known
  unreliability} of PCR virus tests.

  Numerous media reported that in connection with Covid19, more and more
  children would fall ill with so-called \textbf{Kawasaki disease} (a
  vascular inflammation). However, the UK's Kawasaki Disease Foundation
  issued a
  \href{https://www.societi.org.uk/kawasaki-disease-and-covid-19/}{press
  release stating} that \emph{fewer, not more,} Kawasaki cases are
  currently being reported than usual and that of the few cases
  reported, only about half had tested positive for corona virus.
\item
  In an
  \href{https://covidinfos.net/covid19/la-lettre-dun-praticien-hospitalier-adressee-au-ministere-de-la-sante-denonce-une-arnaque-sanitaire/604/}{open
  letter to the French Ministry of Health}, a \textbf{French doctor}
  speaks of Covid19 as ``the biggest health scam of the 21st century''.
  The danger of the virus for the general population is in the range of
  influenza and the consequences of the lockdown are more dangerous than
  the virus itself, the French doctor argues.
\item
  In \textbf{France}, it became known during a subsequent investigation
  that the first Covid19-positive patient had already been treated
  \href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-france-retests/frances-early-covid-19-case-may-hold-clues-to-pandemics-start-idUSKBN22H15R}{at
  the end of December 2019}, one month earlier than previously assumed.
  The man was being treated for what appeared to be flu-related
  pneumonia. This case shows that the new corona virus either arrived in
  Europe earlier than assumed, or that it is not as new as assumed, or
  that the test result was a false-positive. In addition, it is not
  clear whether the man, who has long since recovered, was actually
  suffering from flu or corona virus or both.
\item
  The Executive Director of the WHO recently praised \textbf{Sweden} as
  \href{https://nypost.com/2020/04/29/who-lauds-sweden-as-model-for-resisting-coronavirus-lockdown/}{a
  successful model} for handling Covid19. Sweden had implemented its
  health policy successfully and ``in partnership with the population'',
  he said. Previously, Sweden had been heavily criticized for weeks by
  foreign media and politicians for its relaxed approach to Covid19.
\item
  \textbf{Belarus}, which took the least action against Covid19 of all
  European countries and did not even cancel major events like soccer
  matches, is counting only 103 test-positive or suspected
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Belarus}{Covid19
  deaths} after more than two months. The Belarusian long-term president
  Lukashenko called Corona
  \href{https://www.baltictimes.com/lukashenko__coronavirus_is_psychosis/}{a
  ``psychosis''}. Critics argue he is not disclosing the real number of
  deaths.
\item
  An
  \href{https://covidinfos.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MasksDon-twork-4.pdf}{extensive
  literature review} by a Canadian researcher found that \textbf{face
  masks} do not provide measurable protection against colds and
  influenza.
\item
  A Swiss chief psychiatrist expects a sharp increase in
  \textbf{psychological problems} and
  \href{https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/kanton-aargau/aargauer-psychiatrie-chefarzt-kawohl-warnt-arbeitslosigkeit-erhoeht-das-suizidrisiko-137742663}{more
  than 10,000 additional suicides} worldwide due to the global lockdown
  and unemployment.
\item
  The so-called \textbf{reproduction number}, which indicates the
  proliferation of Covid, is increasingly becoming
  \href{https://www.tagesschau.de/faktenfinder/corona-reproduktionszahl-101.html}{a
  political issue}. However, this does not change the facts: the peak of
  the spread was already reached in most countries before the lockdown
  and the reproduction ratio fell to or below the stable value of one
  due to simple everyday and hygiene measures. The lockdown was
  therefore epidemiologically
  \href{https://infekt.ch/2020/04/sind-wir-tatsaechlich-im-blindflug/}{unnecessary}.
\item
  The \textbf{clinical picture and risk groups} of Covid19 corona
  viruses are probably related to the use of the so-called
  \href{https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200420/ACE2-TMPRSS2-profiling-indicates-tissue-vulnerability-to-SARS-CoV-2-infection.aspx}{ACE2
  cell receptor}, which is found in the bronchi and lungs, but also in
  blood vessels, the intestines and kidneys. However, other
  coronaviruses such as the
  \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369385/}{common
  cold virus NL63}, also use the ACE2 cell receptor. Some researchers
  therefore
  \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7074995/}{expect
  that} the Covid19 coronavirus, too, will be seen as a typical cold
  virus in the medium term.
\item
  The exact \textbf{origin of the new corona virus} is still unclear.
  The easiest explanation remains natural transmission or mutation,
  which happens quite often. It is true, however, that the virological
  laboratory in Wuhan, as part of a
  \href{https://www.newsweek.com/dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan-lab-millions-us-dollars-risky-coronavirus-research-1500741}{research
  programme co-financed by the US}, studied corona viruses from bats and
  also examined their transmissibility to other mammals, something that
  has been criticised for years by some researchers as too risky. The
  director of the laboratory, however, explained that the new virus
  \href{https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/}{did
  not correspond} to the corona viruses investigated in the laboratory.
  At any rate, earlier rumours about ``bioweapons'' or ``HIV sequences''
  turned out to be
  \href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eci.13222}{disinformation}
  given the relative harmlessness of the corona virus.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{nursing-homes}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Nursing
Homes}}{Nursing Homes}}\label{nursing-homes}}

Nursing homes play an
\href{https://ltccovid.org/2020/04/12/mortality-associated-with-covid-19-outbreaks-in-care-homes-early-international-evidence/}{absolutely
key role} in the current corona situation. In most Western countries,
30\% to 70\% of all deaths ``related to Covid'' occurred in nursing
homes (in some regions even up to 90\%). It is also known from northern
Italy that the crisis there began with a
\href{https://swprs.org/covid-19-a-report-from-italy/}{panic-induced
collapse of nursing care for the elderly}.

Nursing homes require targeted protection and do not benefit from a
general lockdown of society. If one looks only at the deaths in the
general population, in most countries these are in the range of a normal
or even mild wave of influenza.

Moreover, in many cases it is not clear what people in nursing homes
really died of, i.e. whether it was Covid19 or stress, fear and
loneliness. From Belgium, for example, it is known that
\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20200424212535/https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/Meest\%20recente\%20update.pdf}{about
94\%} of all deaths in nursing homes are untested ``presumed cases''.

A
\href{https://covidinfos.net/covid19/deces-dus-au-covid-19-le-nombre-officiel-de-morts-en-france-est-il-surestime/502/}{new
analysis of French statistics} moreover shows the following: as soon as
there is a ``suspected case'' in a nursing home (e.g. due to coughing),
all deaths are considered ``suspected Covid19 deaths'', and as soon as
there is a ``confirmed case'' in a nursing home (even if symptomless),
all deaths are considered ``confirmed Covid19 deaths''.

A report from Germany vividly describes the
\href{https://www.rnd.de/gesundheit/corona-ist-mir-egal-warum-helga-witt-kronshage-86-lieber-sterben-will-als-eingesperrt-zu-sein-3MEBDIOBEFA6BDULC4N5WGZJG4.html}{extreme
conditions} under which hundreds of thousands of patients in care and
nursing homes have had to live in recent weeks, often against their
will. Many of the patients were barely allowed to leave their rooms,
were no longer allowed to go out into the fresh air or receive visits
from their relatives.

In several nursing homes, the error-prone PCR virus test moreover led to
\href{https://www.wjhl.com/local-coronavirus-coverage/agape-nursing-home-says-residents-who-tested-positive-for-covid-19-were-false-positives/}{serious
false alarms} and panic. In one Canadian nursing home, employees fled in
fear of the corona virus, resulting in the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/world/canada/montreal-nursing-homes-coronavirus.html}{tragic
death of 31 patients} due to lack of care.

The former New York Times journalist and Corona critic Alex Berenson
\href{https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1257496834043531267}{writes
on Twitter}: ``Let's be clear: the fact the nursing home deaths are not
front and center every day in elite media coverage of COVID tells you
everything you need to know about the media's priority -- which is
instilling panic (and punishing Trump), not driving good health
policy.''

  ``for fear of spreading the virus''. It is ``a horror movie'', ``not

  had already reached its peak on April 7th. Covid19 is a serious
  matter, but the fear of it is exaggerated, as the vast majority of the

A lot of people are shocked by the dubious and often fear-mongering
Covid19 reporting of many media outlets. Obviously, this is not
``ordinary reporting'', but classical and massive propaganda, as it is
typically employed in connection with
\href{https://swprs.org/propaganda-in-the-war-on-yugoslavia/}{wars of
aggression} or alleged
\href{https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/terror-factory-fbi-trevor-aaronson-book/}{terrorism}.

SPR has depicted the media networks responsible for the dissemination of
such propaganda in earlier infographics
\href{https://swprs.org/the-american-empire-and-its-media/}{for the
USA}, for \href{https://swprs.org/netzwerk-medien-deutschland/}{Germany}
and for \href{https://swprs.org/netzwerk-medien-schweiz/}{Switzerland}.
Even the supposedly ``open'' Internet lexicon Wikipedia is
\href{https://swprs.org/wikipedia-disinformation-operation/}{an integral
part} of this geopolitical media structure.

The political stance and relationship to power of different media
outlets have been analyzed and compared as part of the
\href{https://swprs.org/media-navigator/}{SPR Media Navigator}. The
Media Navigator may also be helpful in evaluating the current Covid19
reporting by different media outlets.

If, for example, pictures of soldiers in protective suits disinfecting
entire streets are seen on television, this does not prove the danger of
the corona virus, but rather -- as Professor Giesecke
\href{https://www.addendum.org/coronavirus/interview-johan-giesecke/}{put
it benevolently} -- proves useless ``political activism''. Or as others
would put it: propaganda.

\hypertarget{covid-19-and-mass-surveillance}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Covid-19 and mass
surveillance}}{Covid-19 and mass surveillance}}\label{covid-19-and-mass-surveillance}}

By far the most significant and, from a civil society perspective, the
most dangerous development in response to the coronavirus is the
apparent political attempt to massively expand mass surveillance and
control of society. In this context, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden
warned of the emergence of an
\href{https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bvge5q/snowden-warns-governments-are-using-coronavirus-to-build-the-architecture-of-oppression}{``architecture
of oppression''}.

The flu-like coronavirus may serve as a rationale or pretext for the
introduction of
\href{https://norberthaering.de/die-regenten-der-welt/id2020-ktdi-apple-google/}{strategic
measures} to expand monitoring and control of an increasingly uneasy
society. The most important instruments currently under discussion by
several governments include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The introduction of applications for ``tracing'' contacts across
  society
\item
  The establishment of units to enforce the tracing and isolation of
  citizens
\item
  The introduction of digital biometric ID cards to control and regulate
  participation in social and professional activities.
\item
  The extended control of travel and payment transactions (including the
  abolition of cash).
\item
  The creation of a legal basis for access to and intervention in
  citizens' biological systems by governments or corporations (based on
  so-called ``compulsory vaccinations'').
\end{enumerate}

In the US, former President Bill Clinton discussed the introduction of a
national network of ``contact tracers''
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ug9XHT9JQQ}{with governors of
various states} in April. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, then
announced that together with billionaire and former New York City mayor
Michael Bloomberg, he would
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/contact-tracing-new-york-cuomo-plan/}{create
a ``contact tracing army''} with up to 17,000 contact tracers for New
York.

Meanwhile, in the UK and many other countries, governments are calling
for the introduction of
\href{https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/the-uk-just-published-blueprints-for-covid-19-immunity-passports-a-controversial-potential-route-out-of-lockdown/ar-BB13qr8L}{biometric
``immunity passports''} and presenting them as the allegedly ``only way
out'' of the primarily politically motivated lockdown. The British Tony
Blair Institute called for the
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/surveillance-a-price-worth-paying-to-beat-coronavirus-says-blair-thinktank}{``expansion
of technological surveillance''} to ``combat the corona virus''.

In the US, the Silicon Valley data analysis company Palantir is to play
a key role in
\href{https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/team-trump-turns-to-peter-thiel-s-palantir-to-track-virus/ar-BB130qfE}{setting
up the data platform} for monitoring the (already declining) spread of
the corona virus. Palantir is known for its IT projects with
intelligence agencies and the military and was founded by US billionaire
and Trump supporter Peter Thiel.

In Israel, contact monitoring of the civilian population is
\href{https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200402/14261944226/controversial-spyware-vendor-nso-group-is-helping-israeli-government-spy-own-citizens.shtml}{carried
out by} the domestic intelligence service Shin Bet, using programs from
the notorious NSO Group, known for its spy software used to monitor
civil and human rights activists around the world.

Countries like Russia and China also want to
\href{https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/01/825329399/moscow-launches-new-surveillance-app-to-track-residents-in-coronavirus-lockdown}{massively
expand} the surveillance of the population in the wake of the alleged
``corona crisis'', but will most likely do so independently of the US.

The idea that a pandemic can be used to expand control of the population
is not new: as early as 2010, the American Rockefeller Foundation
described a „lock step scenario`` in a
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rockefeller-foundation-scenarios-2010.pdf}{report
on future technological and social developments}, in which current
events were anticipated with impressive accuracy (pages 18ff). At the
time, the scenario was conceived as a kind of authoritarian ``worst
case''.

Meanwhile, more than 500 scientists have warned in an open letter
against
\href{https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/sites/contact-tracing-joint-statement/}{``unprecedented
surveillance of society''} through contact tracking apps.

The so-called Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University,
which is at the heart of the Covid19 pandemic management and which has
contributed greatly to the global escalation through its misleading
charts, is also
\href{http://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/04/investigative-series/all-roads-lead-to-dark-winter/}{very
closely linked to the US security apparatus} and has been involved in
some of its earlier simulations and operations.

In general, cooperation with private actors to achieve geostrategic
goals is not a new or unusual phenomenon in US foreign and security
policy.

For instance, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQSYdAX_9JY}{most important
private sponsor} of the WHO, the vaccine industry and biometric ID
projects, financed a
\href{https://www.cfr.org/news-releases/council-establishes-senior-fellowship-global-health-and-foreign-policy-grant-bill}{Global
Health Program} of the US Council on Foreign Relations as early as 2003,
which is concerned with the question of how health policy influences
geopolitics and, conversely, how health policy can be used to achieve
geostrategic goals.

  The former Swedish and European chief epidemiologist Professor Johan
  Giesecke gave the Austrian magazine Addendum

  epidemic is ``invisible'' because that many people develop no or
  hardly any symptoms. A lockdown would therefore be ``pointless'' and
  harm society. The basis of the Swedish strategy was that ``people are
  not stupid''. Giesecke expects a death rate between 0.1 and 0.2\%,
  similar to that of influenza. Italy and New York had been very poorly
  prepared for the virus and had not protected their risk groups,
  Professor Giesecke argues.
\item
  The
  \href{https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Bollettino-sorveglianza-integrata-COVID-19_16-aprile-2020.pdf\#page=13}{latest
  figures from Italy} show (pp. 12/13) that 60 of almost 17,000 doctors
  and nurses who tested positive died. This results in a Covid19
  lethality rate of less than 0.1\% for those under 50, 0.27\% for those
  aged 50 to 60, 1.4\% for those aged 60 to 70, and 12.6\% for those
  aged 70 to 80. Even these figures are likely too high, as these are
  deaths \emph{with} and not necessarily \emph{from} corona viruses, and
  as up to 80\% of people remain asymptomatic and some may not have been
  tested. Overall, however, the values are in line with those from e.g.
  South Korea and give a lethality rate for the general population in

  Lombardy, and that in many cases the cause of death was not yet clear.
  It was already known beforehand that the care of the elderly and
  nursing homes and, as a result, the entire health care system in parts
  of Lombardy had collapsed, in part due to
  \href{https://swprs.org/covid-19-a-report-from-italy/}{fear of the

\item
  The
  \href{https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/Meest\%20recente\%20update.pdf}{latest

  additional deaths occur in nursing homes, which do not benefit from a
  general lockdown. In 6\% of these deaths Covid19 was ``confirmed'', in
  94\% of the deaths it was ``suspected''. About 70\% of the
  test-positive persons (employees and residents) showed no symptoms.

  The Californian physician Dr. Dan Erickson described his observations

  press briefing}. Hospitals and intensive care units in California and
  other states have remained largely empty so far. Dr. Erickson reports
  that doctors from several US states have been ``pressured'' to issue
  death certificates mentioning Covid19, even though they themselves did
  not agree. Dr. Erickson recommends quarantining only the sick and not
  the healthy or the whole society, as this could have negative effects
  on health and psyche. A significant increase in ``secondary effects''
  such as alcoholism, depression, suicide and abuse of children and
  spouses has already been observed. Based on figures from various
  countries, Dr. Erickson estimates the lethality of Covid-19 to be
  about 0.1\% or similar to influenza. According to Dr Erickson, a face
  mask only makes sense in acute situations such as in hospital, but not
  in everyday life. (\textbf{Note}: Youtube deleted the press briefing

  of the Covid19 virus is \emph{negative} and only the more general
  corona virus target sequence is positive. However, this can lead to
  other corona viruses (cold viruses) also trigger a false positive test
  result. The laboratory also explained that Covid19 antibodies are
  often only detectable two to three weeks after the onset of symptoms.
  This must be taken into account so that the actual number of people

  the lack of scientific justification for the corona measures}: ``The
  reported figures on new infections very dramatically overestimate the
  true spread of the corona virus. The observed rapid increase in new
  infections is almost exclusively due to the fact that the number of
  tests has increased rapidly over time (see figure below). So, at least
  according to the reported figures, there was in reality never an
  exponential spread of the coronavirus. The reported figures on new
  infections hide the fact that the number of new infections has been
  decreasing since about early or mid-March.''

Some readers were surprised by the decrease in deaths in Sweden, as most
media show a steeply \emph{rising} curve. What is the reason for this?
Most media show \emph{cumulative} figures by date of \emph{reporting},
while the Swedish authorities publish the much more meaningful
\emph{daily} figures by date of \emph{death}.

The Swedish authorities always stress that not all newly reported cases
have died within the last 24 hours, but many media ignore this (see
graph below). Although the latest Swedish figures may still increase
somewhat, as in all countries, this does not change the generally
declining trend.

In addition, these figures represent deaths \emph{with} and not
necessarily \emph{from} coronavirus. The average age of death in Sweden
is also over 80 years, about 50\% of deaths occurred in vulnerable
nursing homes, while the effect on the general population has remained
minimal, even though Sweden has one of the
\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8}{lowest
intensive care capacities} in Europe.

However, the Swedish government has also been given
\href{https://www.tagesschau.de/faktenfinder/ausland/corona-kursaenderung-schweden-103.html}{new
emergency powers} due to ``corona'' and could still participate in later
contact tracing programmes.

Deaths in the UK have risen sharply in recent weeks, but are still in
the range of the \href{http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/}{strongest flu
seasons} of the last fifty years (see chart below). In the UK, too,
\href{https://ltccovid.org/2020/04/12/mortality-associated-with-covid-19-outbreaks-in-care-homes-early-international-evidence/}{up
to 50\%} of additional deaths occur in nursing homes, which do not
benefit from a general lockdown.

Moreover,
\href{https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-record-weekly-death-toll-as-fearful-patients-avoid-hospitals-bm73s2tw3}{up
to 50\%} of the additional deaths are said to be non-Covid19 deaths and
\href{https://www.ft.com/content/67e6a4ee-3d05-43bc-ba03-e239799fa6ab}{up
to 25\%} of the additional deaths occur at home. It is therefore not at
all clear whether the general lockdown is beneficial or in fact
detrimental to society at large.

The editor of the British \emph{Spectator}
\href{https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/09/boris-worried-lockdown-has-gone-far-can-end/}{has
claimed that} government agencies expect the lockdown to result in up to
150,000 additional deaths in the longer term, significantly more than
what Covid19 is expected to cause. Most recently, the case of a
17-year-old student and singer who took her own life because of the
lockdown
\href{https://sports.yahoo.com/coronavirus-bethany-palmer-teenager-death-suicide-152707750.html}{became
known}.

It is striking that England, in contrast to most other countries
(including Sweden), has a significantly elevated mortality rate even
\href{https://www.euromomo.eu/}{among 15 to 64-year-olds}. This could be
due to the frequent cardiovascular preconditions, or it might be caused
by the
\href{https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/two-new-waves-deaths-break-nhs-new-analysis-warns/}{effects
of the lockdown}.

The \href{http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/}{InProportion project} has
published numerous new graphs that put current UK mortality in relation
to previous flu outbreaks and other causes of death. Other websites that
critically review the British situation and measures are

In 2007, the US health authorities defined a
\href{https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2007/02/hhs-ties-pandemic-mitigation-advice-severity}{five-tier
classification} for pandemic influenza and counter-measures. The five
categories are based on the observed lethality (CFR) of the pandemic,
from category 1 (\textless{}0.1\%) to category 5 (\textgreater{}2\%).
According to this key, the current corona pandemic would probably be
classified in category 2 (0.1\% to 0.5\%). For this category, only the
``voluntary isolation of sick persons'' was envisaged as the main
measure at the time.

In 2009, however, the WHO
\href{https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html\#5ae32fb848e8}{deleted
severity from its pandemic definition}. Since then, in principle, every
global wave of influenza can be declared a pandemic, as happened with
the very mild ``swine flu'' of 2009/2010, for which vaccines worth
around 18 billion dollars were sold.

The documentary TrustWHO (``Trust who?''), which deals with the dubious
role of the WHO in the context of ``swine flu'',

Zurich to show that the Covid19 epidemic was already under control
before the ``lockdown'' was even introduced:

``These results are explosive: Both studies show that simple measures
such as the renunciation of major events and the introduction of hygiene
measures are highly effective. The population is able to implement these
recommendations well and the measures can almost bring the epidemic to a
halt. In any case, the measures are sufficient to protect our health
system in such a way that the hospitals are not overburdened''.

The latest figures on patients and deaths show that the epidemic is
coming to an end in Sweden. In Sweden, as in most other countries,
excess mortality occurred mainly in nursing homes that were not
protected well enough, the chief epidemiologist
\href{https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/15/sweden-coronavirus-rates-easing-despite-loose-rule/}{explained}.

Compared to other countries, the Swedish population may now benefit from
higher immunity to the Covid19 virus, which could better protect them
from a possible ``second wave'' next winter.

It can be assumed that by the end of 2020, Covid19 will not be visible
in the Swedish overall mortality. The Swedish example shows that
``lockdowns'' were medically unnecessary or even counterproductive as
well as socially and economically devastating.

In the face of a lack of scientific evidence, some media increasingly

A typical example are ``healthy children'' who allegedly died of
Covid19, but who later often turn out

still showed reduced performance and conspicuous imaging. One section
speaks of ``irreversible damage'', the next explains that this is
``unclear and speculative''. It is not mentioned that divers should
generally take a

Neurological effects such as the temporary loss of the sense of smell or
taste are also often mentioned. Here too, it is usually not explained
that this is a
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294743}{well-known effect}
of cold and flu viruses, and Covid19 is
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23948436}{rather mild in this
respect}.

In other reports, possible effects on various organs such as kidneys,
liver or brain are highlighted, without mentioning that many of the
patients affected were already very old and had severe

  in the range of a severe influenza). In people over 70 years of age
  \emph{with no serious preconditions}, the mortality rate is expected
  to be less than 1\%. For people over 80 years of age, the mortality
  rate is between 3\% and 15\%, depending on whether deaths so far were
  mainly \emph{with} or \emph{from} by the disease. In contrast to
  influenza, child mortality is close to zero. With regard to the high
  mortality rate in Northern Italy, the research group points out that
  Italy has the

  less (i.e. in the area of seasonal influenza). According to Paunio,

  the hospitals for fear of corona. There were 150,000 free hospital

invasive ventilation (intubation). Covid19 patients do not suffer from
acute respiratory failure (ARDS), but from oxygen deficiency, possibly
caused by an oxygen diffusion problem triggered by the virus or the
immune response to it.

  An analysis of data from five European countries shows that residents

  42\% and 57\% of all ``Covid19 deaths''}. At the same time, three US
  studies show that up to 50\% of all test positive nursing home
  residents did not (yet) show symptoms at the time of testing. Two
  conclusions can be drawn from this: On the one hand, the danger of the
  new coronavirus -- as already suspected -- seems to be concentrated on
  a small, very vulnerable population group that needs even better
  protection. On the other hand, it is conceivable that some of these
  people may not die, or not only die from the coronavirus, but also

  priorities were set and all ethical principles were violated''. There
  is a ``very one-sided orientation towards intensive care'', although
  ``the balance between benefit and harm'' is often not good. A new
  diagnosis (i.e. Covid19) would turn elderly patients who in the past
  had mostly been treated palliatively into intensive care patients and
  subject them to a painful but often hopeless treatment (i.e.
  artificial respiration). The treatment should always be based on the
  actual will of the patient, the specialist argued.

  the interrogation. The police justified the deployment of the special
  unit by assuming that the doctor was in possession of a weapon -- but
  this was the usual Swiss medical army pistol without ammunition. The
  transfer of the doctor to a psychiatric clinic was justified on the
  grounds of an alleged ``incapacity to serve in prison'' (as is the

the over-65 age group in several European countries. In some countries,
however, including Germany and Austria, mortality in this age group is
still in the normal range (or even below).

The question remains open as to whether the partially increased
mortality is due to the coronavirus alone or also due to the sometimes
drastic measures taken (e.g. isolation, stress, cancelled operations,
etc.), and whether mortality will still be increased in the annual view.

Among the age groups under 65 years, so far only in England there is a
projected increase in mortality beyond earlier waves of influenza. The
median age of test-positive deceased is 80 in Italy, 83 in Germany and

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Northern

Regarding northern Italy, several potential risk factors have recently
been discussed.

It is true that two major vaccination campaigns against
\href{https://www.bergamonews.it/2019/10/21/vaccinazione-antinfluenzale-a-bergamo-ordinate-185-000-dosi-di-vaccino/332164/}{influenza}
and
\href{https://www.bsnews.it/2020/01/18/meningite-vaccinate-34mila-persone-tra-brescia-e-bergamo/}{meningococcus}
were carried out in Lombardy in the months immediately preceding the
outbreak of Covid19, notably in the later hotspots of Bergamo and
Brescia. Although it is \emph{theoretically possible} that such
vaccinations could interact with coronavirus infections, such a
possibility has not been established at present.

It is also true that a
\href{https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/asbest-prozess-in-italien-nun-sind-alle-krank-a-666421.html}{high
asbestos exposure} was present in northern Italy in the past, which
increases the risk of \emph{cancerous} lung disease. But here again,
there is no \emph{direct connection} with Covid19.

Nevertheless, in general it is true that the lung health of the
population in northern Italy has been affected for a long time by high
levels of \href{https://twitter.com/esa/status/1238480433047916545}{air
pollution} and other detrimental factors, making it
\href{https://www.thelocal.it/20170131/our-lungs-are-breaking-smog-levels-way-above-safe-limits-in-northern-italy}{particularly
susceptible} to respiratory diseases.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Swiss chief physician Pietro
Vernazza}}{Swiss chief physician Pietro Vernazza}}\label{swiss-chief-physician-pietro-vernazza}}

The Swiss chief physician of Infectiology, Professor Pietro Vernazza,
has published four new articles on studies concerning Covid19.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The
  \href{https://infekt.ch/2020/04/schulen-schliessen-hilfreich-oder-nicht/}{first
  article} is about the fact that there has never been medical evidence
  for the efficacy of \textbf{school closures}, as children in general
  do not develop the Covid disease nor are they among the vectors of the
  virus (unlike with influenza).
\item
  The
  \href{https://infekt.ch/2020/04/atemschutzmasken-fuer-alle-medienhype-oder-unverzichtbar/}{second
  article} is about the fact that \textbf{respiratory masks} generally
  have no detectable effect, with one exception: sick people \emph{with
  symptoms} (notably coughing) can reduce the spread of the virus.
  Otherwise the masks are rather symbolic or a ``media hype''.
\item
  The~\href{https://infekt.ch/2020/04/corona-testen-testen-und-kein-ende/}{third
  article} deals with the question of \textbf{mass testing}. The
  conclusion of Professor Vernazza: ``Anyone who has symptoms of a
  respiratory disease stays at home. The same applies to the flu. There
  is no added value in testing.''
\item
  The\href{https://infekt.ch/2020/03/immunschwaeche-und-schwangerschaft-kein-covid-19-risikofaktor/}{fourth
  article} deals with the Covid19 \textbf{risk groups}. According to
  current knowledge, these include people with high blood pressure -- it
  is suspected that the Covid19 virus uses cell receptors that are also
  responsible for regulating blood pressure. However, surprisingly,
  people with immunodeficiency and pregnant women (who naturally have a
  reduced immune system) are not at risk. On the contrary, the risk of
  Covid19 is often an \emph{overreaction} of the immune system.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{intensive-vs-palliative-care}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Intensive vs. palliative
care}}{Intensive vs. palliative care}}\label{intensive-vs-palliative-care}}

A German palliative physician
\href{https://www.ruhr24.de/ruhrgebiet/coronavirus-behandlung-intensivstation-nrw-lungenentzuendung-matthias-thoens-witten-zr-13645038.html}{explains
in an interview} that Covid19 is ``not an intensive care disease'', as
the severely affected people are typically people of old age who have
multiple pre-existing conditions. When these people get pneumonia, they
``have always been given palliative care (i.e. accompanying death)''.
With a Covid19 diagnosis, however, this would now become an intensive
care case, but ``of course the patients still cannot be saved''.

The expert describes the current actions of many decision-makers as
``panic mode''. At present, intensive care beds in Germany are still
relatively empty. Respirators are free. For financial reasons, hospital
managers may soon come up with the idea of admitting elderly people.
``In 14 days, the wards will be full of unsalvageable, multimorbid old
people. And once they are on the machines, the question arises as to who
will switch them off again, as that would be a homicide.'' An ``ethical
catastrophe'' from greed may ensue, warns the physician.

\hypertarget{ventilation-with-covid19-1}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Ventilation with
Covid19}}{Ventilation with Covid19}}\label{ventilation-with-covid19-1}}

There has been and still is a worldwide rush for ventilators for Covid19
patients. This site was one of the first in the world to draw attention
to the fact that invasive ventilation (intubation) may be
counterproductive in many cases and may cause additional harm to
patients.

Invasive ventilation was originally recommended because low oxygen
levels led to the false conclusion of acute respiratory (lung) failure,
and there was a fear that with more gentle, non-invasive techniques the
virus could spread through aerosols.

In the meantime, several leading pulmonologists and intensive care
physicians from the US and Europe have spoken out against invasive
ventilation and recommend more gentle methods or indeed oxygen therapy,
as already successfully used by South Korea.

  The\href{https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/coronavirus-regierung-ignoriert-daten}{latest
  figures from a special report} by the German Robert Koch Institute
  show that the so-called positive rate (i.e. the number of test
  positives per number of tests) is increasing much more slowly than the
  exponential curves shown by the media and was only around 10\% at the
  end of March, a value that is rather typical for corona viruses.
  According to the magazine \emph{Multipolar}, there can therefore be
  ``no question of a dangerously rapid spread of the virus''.

  Professor Klaus Püschel, head of forensic medicine in Hamburg,
  \href{https://www.pressreader.com/germany/hamburger-morgenpost/20200403/281487868456736}{explains
  about Covid19}: ``This virus influences our lives in a completely
  excessive way. This is disproportionate to the danger posed by the
  virus. And the astronomical economic damage now being caused is not
  commensurate with the danger posed by the virus. I am convinced that
  the Corona mortality rate will not even show up as a peak in annual
  mortality.'' In Hamburg, for example, ``not a single person who was
  not previously ill'' had died of the virus: ``All those we have
  examined so far had cancer, a chronic lung disease, were heavy smokers
  or severely obese, suffered from diabetes or had a cardiovascular
  disease. The virus was the last straw that broke the camel's back, so
  to speak. ``Covid-19 is a fatal disease only in exceptional cases, but
  in most cases it is a predominantly harmless viral infection.''\\
  In addition,
  \href{https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article228828787/rechtsmedizin-pueschel-hamburg-corona-virus-infektion-covid-19-coronavirus-krise-patienten-krankenhaeuser-kliniken-infektionsrate-krankheit-pandemie-test-lungenkrankheit-sars-cov-epidemie-sars-cov-2.html}{Dr.
  Püschel explains}: ``In quite a few cases, we have also found that the
  current corona infection has nothing whatsoever to do with the fatal
  outcome because other causes of death are present, for example a brain
  haemorrhage or a heart attack. Corona in itself is a ``not
  particularly dangerous viral disease'', says the forensic scientist.
  He pleads for statistics based on concrete examination results. ``All
  speculations about individual deaths that have not been expertly
  examined only fuel anxiety.'' Contrary to the guidelines of the Robert
  Koch Institute, Hamburg had recently started to differentiate between
  deaths ``with the'' and ``by the'' coronavirus, which led to a
  decrease in Covid19 deaths.
\item
  The German virologist Hendrik Streeck is currently conducting a pilot
  study to determine the distribution and transmission routes of the
  Covid19 pathogen. In

  interview he explains}: ``I took a closer look at the cases of 31 of
  the 40 people who died in the Heinsberg district -- and was not very
  surprised that these people died. One of the deceased was older than
  100 years, so even a common cold could have led to death.'' Contrary

  The first Swiss hospitals have to

  in all departments has too little to do and has reduced overtime in a
  first step. Now short-time work is also being registered. The
  financial consequences are severe.'' As a reminder, a study by ETH
  Zurich based on largely unrealistic assumptions

  \href{https://www.nzz.ch/lungenentzuendung-1.4550285}{1300 people} die
  in Switzerland every year as a result of pneumonia, 95\% of whom are

  susceptible to viral infections} such as Covid19 due to a notoriously
  high legionella contamination: ``If the lungs are weakened by a viral

\item
  On the basis of information from China, medical protocols have been
  defined worldwide that rapidly provide \textbf{invasive artificial
  respiration by intubation} for test-positive intensive care patients.
  On the one hand, the protocols assume that a more gentle non-invasive
  ventilation through a mask is too weak, on the other hand there is the
  fear that the ``dangerous virus'' could otherwise spread through
  aerosols. As early as March, however, German physicians
  \href{https://www.doccheck.com/de/detail/articles/26271-covid-19-beatmung-und-dann}{pointed
  out that} intubation can lead to additional lung damage and has an
  overall poor chance of success. In the meantime, US physicians have
  also come forward who describe intubation as
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9GYTc53r2o}{``more harm than
  good''} for patients. Patients often do not suffer from acute lung
  failure, but rather from a kind of altitude sickness, which is made
  worse by artificial respiration with increased pressure. In February,

\textbf{USA}: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pIMD1enwd4}{Videos

media as ``war zones'', it is in fact still very quiet. (Note: Some

\textbf{Austria}: In Austria, too, ``corona deaths'' are apparently
defined ``very liberally'',
\href{https://www.heute.at/s/osterreich-bei-corona-todesstatistik-sehr-liberal-48665863}{as
the media report}: ``Do you also count as a corona death if you are
infected with the virus but die of something else? Yes, say Rudi
Anschober and Bernhard Benka, members of the Corona Task Force in the
Ministry of Health. ``There is a clear rule at present: Died with the
corona virus or died from the corona virus both count for the
statistics.'' No difference is made as to what the patient actually died
of. In other words, a 90-year-old man who dies with a fracture of the
femoral neck and becomes infected with corona in the hours prior to his
death is also counted as corona death. To name but one example.''

\textbf{Germany}: The German Robert Koch Institute now
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSn_YaOYYcY}{advises against
autopsies} of test-positive deceased persons because the risk of droplet
infection by aerosols is allegedly too high. In many cases, this means
that the real cause of death can no longer be determined.

A specialist in pathology
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSn_YaOYYcY}{comments on this} as
follows: ``Who might think evil of it! Up to now, it has been a matter
of course for pathologists to carry out autopsies with appropriate
safety precautions even in the case of infectious diseases such as
HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, tuberculosis, PRION diseases, etc. It is quite
remarkable that in a disease that is killing thousands of patients all
over the world and bringing the economy of entire countries to a virtual
standstill, only very few autopsy findings are available (six patients
from China). From the point of view of both the epidemic police and the
scientific community, there should be a particularly high level of
public interest in autopsy findings. However, the opposite is the case.
Are you afraid of finding out the true causes of death of the positively
tested deceased? Could it be that the numbers of corona deaths would
then melt away like snow in the spring sun?''

\textbf{Italy}: Russian experts have noticed
\href{https://de.sputniknews.com/panorama/20200402326767475-fachpersonal-todesfaelle-lombardei-zeitung/}{``strange
deaths''} in nursing homes in Lombardy: ``According to newspaper
reports, several cases have been registered in the town of Gromo in
which alleged corona virus-infected persons simply fell asleep and never
woke up again. \emph{No real symptoms of the disease had been observed
in the deceased until then}. () As the director of the nursing home
later clarified in an interview with RIA Novosti, it is unclear whether
the deceased were actually infected with the coronavirus, because nobody
in the home had been tested for it. () In the homes, where medical and
nursing teams from Russia are working, corridors, bed rooms and dining
rooms are disinfected.''

Similar cases have already been
\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20200330082928/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/coronavirus-news-deutschland-wolfsburg-laschet-1.4828033}{reported}
from Germany: Nursing patients without symptoms of illness die suddenly
in the current exceptional situation and are then considered ``corona
deaths''. Here again the serious question arises: Who dies from the
virus and who dies from the sometimes extreme measures?

\textbf{Nursing staff}: The \emph{Süddeutsche Zeitung}

According to the
\href{https://influenza.rki.de/Wochenberichte/2019_2020/2020-13.pdf}{latest
influenza report} of the German Robert Koch Institute, the number of
acute respiratory diseases has ``fallen sharply nationwide''. The values
have ``dropped in all age groups''.

By March 20, the total number of inpatient cases with acute respiratory
diseases had also fallen significantly. In the age group from 80 years
and older, the number of cases had almost halved compared to the
previous week.

In the 73 hospitals examined, 7\% of all cases with respiratory diseases
were diagnosed with COVID-19. In the age groups 35-59 years it was 16\%
and in the age group 60-79 years it was 13\% who received a COVID-19
diagnosis.

These figures correspond to those from other countries as well as to the
typical prevalence of coronaviruses (5 to 15\%).

An
\href{https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2020-04/krankenhaeuser-kapazitaeten-coronavirus-patienten-deutschland/seite-2}{article
in DIE ZEIT} discusses the issue of intensive care patients in Germany:

``At present politicians, experts and many citizens observe with concern
the exponentially increasing number of people who are newly infected
every day. However, this is not the decisive indicator for assessing how
badly the corona crisis is and will hit Germany. For it is distorted
above all by the number of tests, which have been increasing for weeks.

In order to measure the burden on the health system, the number of those
who are so seriously ill that they need to be ventilated is particularly
important. As long as there are enough ventilation places for them, a
great many of them can be saved. Only when these beds become scarce does
a situation like the one in Italy threaten.

The DIVI register now shows that the situation in the German intensive
care units has been relaxed so far. ``We are still in a comfortable
area,'' says Grabenhenrich. The number of seriously ill patients is not
rising as steeply as the number of infected patients and even if it did,
it would still be possible to provide a large number of intensive care
beds with very good equipment.

\hypertarget{switzerland-2}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Switzerland}}{Switzerland}}\label{switzerland-2}}

The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health
\href{https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/situation-schweiz-und-international.html}{reports}
that approximately 139,330 Covid19 tests have been carried out so far,
of which the result was positive in 15\% of cases. This number also
corresponds to the typical corona virus value known from other countries
and, as far as can be seen, does not seem to be increasing rapidly in
Switzerland either.

Only the number of tests often mentioned in the media is increasing
exponentially, but not the number of ``infected'', sick or even dead.

On March 31, however, a new
\href{https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/gesundheit/gesundheitszustand/sterblichkeit-todesursachen.html}{weekly
mortality statistic} was published which for the first time forecasts an
increase in overall mortality in the 65+ age group in Switzerland for
the 12th calendar week (until 22 March) (see chart below). Specifically,
total mortality is expected to increase by around 200 deaths \emph{per
week}.

According to the Federal Office, this increase is ``an expression of the
current pandemic''. The following problem arises here: up to 22 March
there were \emph{a total} of
\href{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19-Pandemie_in_der_Schweiz\#Todesf\%C3\%A4lle}{106
test-positive deaths} in Switzerland. An increase of 200 deaths
\emph{per week} would mean that a large part of the additional mortality
is not caused by the virus but by the ``countermeasures''.

Another explanation would be that the approximately 200 test-positive
deaths of the \emph{following week}
(\href{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19-Pandemie_in_der_Schweiz\#Todesf\%C3\%A4lle}{week
13}) have already been included. This would mean that all test-positive
deaths are assumed to be \emph{additional} deaths. However, in view of
the age and disease profile as well as
\href{https://swprs.org/rki-relativiert-corona-todesfaelle/}{international
experience}, this would be a very doubtful assumption.

In fact, the report adds the following disclaimer: ``These initial
estimates are still very uncertain, so that no exact figures can be
published''.

If it turns out that a large proportion of test-positive deaths (median
age: 83 years) are not additional deaths, either the overall mortality
would not be increased, or it would be increased mainly because of the
drastic measures, as
\href{https://swprs.org/open-letter-from-professor-sucharit-bhakdi-to-german-chancellor-dr-angela-merkel/}{some
experts fear}.

\includegraphics{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bfs-mortaliaet-22-03.png?w=600\&h=400}

A Swiss newspaper has presented the current total mortality in
comparison with previous years (see graph below). This illustrates that,
even \emph{if} actually increased, the current mortality rate is still
below the stronger flu winters of recent years.

Italian doctors reported that they had
\href{https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3076334/coronavirus-strange-pneumonia-seen-lombardy-november-leading}{already
observed} severe cases of pneumonia in northern Italy at the end of last
year. However, genetic analyses now show that the Covid19 virus only
appeared in Italy in January of this year. ``The severe pneumonia
diagnosed in Italy in November and December must therefore be due to a
different
pathogen,''\href{https://www.nzz.ch/wissenschaft/coronavirus-der-stammbaum-verraet-woher-es-kommt-ld.1548271}{a
virologist noted}. This once again raises the question what role the
Covid19 virus, or other factors, actually play in the Italian situation.

On March 30, we mentioned the list of Italian doctors who died ``during
the Corona crisis'', many of whom were up to 90 years old and didn't
actively participate in the crisis at all. Today, all years of birth on
the list
\href{https://portale.fnomceo.it/elenco-dei-medici-caduti-nel-corso-dellepidemia-di-covid-19/}{have

\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20200328152430/https://portale.fnomceo.it/elenco-dei-medici-caduti-nel-corso-dellepidemia-di-covid-19/}{archive
version}). A strange procedure.

We have also received the following message from an observer in Italy,
who gives further details about the dramatic situation there, which is
obviously due to far more than a virus:

``In recent weeks, most of the Eastern European nurses who worked 24
hours a day, 7 days a week supporting people in need of care in Italy
have left the country in a hurry. This is not least because of the
panic-mongering and the curfews and border closures threatened by the
``emergency governments''. As a result, old people in need of care and
disabled people, some without relatives, were left helpless by their
carers.

Many of these abandoned people then ended up after a few days in the
hospitals, which had been permanently overloaded for years, because they
were dehydrated, among other things. Unfortunately, the hospitals lacked
the personnel who had to look after the children locked up in their
apartments because schools and kindergartens had been closed. This then
led to the complete collapse of the care for the disabled and the
elderly, especially in those areas where even harder ``measures'' were
ordered, and to chaotic conditions.

The nursing emergency, which was caused by the panic, temporarily led to
many deaths among those in need of care and increasingly among younger
patients in the hospitals. These fatalities then served to cause even
more panic among those in charge and the media, who reported, for
example, ``another 475 fatalities'', ``The dead are being removed from
hospitals by the army'', accompanied by pictures of coffins and army
trucks lined up.

However, this was the result of the funeral directors' fear of the
``killer virus'', who therefore refused their services. Moreover, on the
one hand there were too many deaths at once and on the other hand the
government passed a law that the corpses carrying the coronavirus had to
be cremated. In Catholic Italy, few cremations had been carried out in
the past. Therefore there were only a few small crematoria, which very
quickly reached their limits. Therefore the deceased had to be laid out
in different churches.

In principle, this development is the same in all countries. However,
the quality of the health system has a considerable influence on the
effects. Therefore, there are fewer problems in Germany, Austria or
Switzerland than in Italy, Spain or the USA. However, as can be seen in
the official figures, there is no significant increase in the mortality
rate. Just a small mountain that came from this tragedy.''

\item
  Also in Swiss clinics, no increased occupancy has been observed so
  far. A visitor to the cantonal hospital in Lucerne reports that there
  is ``less activity than in normal times''. Entire floors have been

  which would also cost lives, said the physician.

  \href{https://www.doccheck.com/de/detail/articles/26271-covid-19-beatmung-und-dann}{article

  ventilation through a mask is officially advised against, among other
  things to prevent the coronavirus from spreading through aerosols.
  Therefore, test positive intensive care patients are often intubated
  directly. However, intubation has poor chances of success and often
  leads to additional damage to the lungs (so-called ventilator-induced
  lung damage). As with medication, the question arises as to whether a
  more gentle treatment of patients would not be medically more
  sensible.

Dr. Richard Capek and other researchers
\href{https://coronadaten.wordpress.com/}{have already shown} that the
number of test-positive individuals in relation to the number of tests
performed \emph{remains constant} in all countries studied so far, which
speaks \emph{against} an exponential spread of the virus and merely
indicates an exponential increase in the number of tests.

Depending on the country, the proportion of test-positive individuals is
between 5 and 15\%, which corresponds to the usual spread of corona
viruses. Interestingly, these constant numerical values are not actively
communicated
(\href{https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/coronavirus-irrefuhrung-fallzahlen}{or
even removed}) by authorities and the media. Instead, exponential but
irrelevant and misleading curves are shown without context.

Such behavior, of course, does not correspond to professional medical
standards, as a look at the traditional
\href{https://influenza.rki.de/Saisonberichte/2017.pdf}{influenza
report} of the German Robert Koch Institute makes clear (p. 30, see
chart below). Here, in addition to the number of detections (right), the
number of samples (left, grey bars) and the positive rate (left, blue
curve) are shown.

This immediately shows that during a flu season the positive rate rises
from 0 to 10\% to up to 80\% of the samples and drops back to the normal
value after a few weeks. In comparison, Covid19 tests show a constant
positive rate in the normal range (see below).

applies analogously to all other countries for which data on the number

  irrespective of the measures taken, overall mortality throughout
  Europe remained in the normal range or below by March 25, and often

In several countries, there is increasing evidence in relation to
Covid19 that ``the treatment could be worse than the disease''.

On the one hand, there is the risk of so-called
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital-acquired_infection}{nosocomial
infections}, i.e. infections that the patient, who may only be mildly
ill, acquires in hospital. It is estimated that there are approximately
2.5 million nosocomial infections and 50,000 deaths per year in Europe.
Even in German intensive care units, about 15\% of patients acquire a
nosocomial infection, including pneumonia on artificial respiration.
There is also the problem of increasingly antibiotic-resistant germs in
hospitals.

Another aspect is the certainly well-intentioned but sometimes very
aggressive treatment methods that are increasingly used in Covid19
patients. These include, in particular, the administration of steroids,
antibiotics and anti-viral drugs (or a combination thereof). Already in
the treatment of SARS-1 patients, it has been shown that the outcome
\emph{with} such treatment was
\href{https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206110703.htm}{often
worse and more fatal} than without such treatment.

  German researcher Dr. Richard Capek
  \href{https://coronadaten.wordpress.com/}{argues in a quantitative
  analysis} that the ``Corona epidemic'' is in fact an ``epidemic of

  German Virology professor Dr. Carsten Scheller from the University of
  Würzburg \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-uub0urNfw}{explains

  has so far even led to fewer deaths. Professor Scheller suspects that
  the exponential curves often presented in the media have more to do
  with the \emph{increasing number of tests} than with an unusual spread
  of the virus itself. For countries like Germany, Italy is less of a
  role model than Japan and South Korea. Despite millions of Chinese
  tourists and only minimal social restrictions, these countries have
  not yet experienced a Covid19 crisis. One reason for this could be the
  wearing of mouth masks: This would hardly protect against infection,
  but would limit the spread of the virus by infected people.

  figures from Bergamo (city)} show that total mortality in March 2020
  increased from typically 150 people per month to around 450 people. It

\textbf{Regarding the situation in Italy}: Most major media falsely
report that Italy has up to 800 deaths per day \emph{from the
coronavirus}. In reality, the president of the Italian Civil Protection
Service stresses that these are deaths ``\emph{with} the coronavirus and
\emph{not from} the coronavirus'' (minute 03:30 of the
\href{https://youtu.be/0M4kbPDHGR0?t=210}{press conference}). In other
words, these persons died while also testing positive.

As Professors Ioannidis and Bhakdi
\href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/}{have
shown}, countries like South Korea and Japan that introduced \emph{no
lockdown measures} have experienced near-zero excess mortality in
connection with Covid-19, while the Diamond Princess cruise ship
experienced an extra­polated mortality figure in the \emph{per mille
range}, i.e. at or below the level of the seasonal flu.

Current test-positive death figures in Italy are still less than 50\% of
normal daily overall mortality in Italy, which is around 1800 deaths per
day. Thus it is possible, perhaps even likely, that a large part of
\emph{normal} daily mortality now simply counts as ``Covid19'' deaths
(as they test positive). This is the point stressed by the President of
the Italian Civil Protection Service.

However, by now it is clear that certain regions in Northern Italy, i.e.
those facing the toughest
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italy_coronavirus_lockdown}{lockdown
measures}, are experiencing markedly increased daily mortality figures.
It is also known that in the Lombardy region, 90\% of test-positive
deaths occur \emph{not} in intensive care units, but instead mostly
\href{https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/cronaca/coronavirus-in-lombardia-9-morti-su-10-mai-giunti-in-terapia-intensiva_16362350-202002a.shtml}{at
home}. And more than 99\% have serious pre-existing health conditions.

Professor Sucharit Bhakdi
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBB9bA-gXL4}{has called} lockdown
measures ``useless'', ``self-destructive'' and a ``collective suicide''.
Thus the extremely troubling question arises as to what extent the
increased mortality of these elderly, isolated, highly stressed people
with multiple pre-existing health conditions may in fact be caused by
the weeks-long lockdown measures still in force.

If so, it may be one of those cases where the treatment is worse than
the disease. (See update below: only 12\% of death certificates show the
coronavirus as a cause.)

  A model from Imperial College London predicted between 250,000 and
  500,000 deaths in the UK ``from'' Covid-19, but the authors of the
  study \href{https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51979654}{have now
  conceded} that many of these deaths would not be in addition to, but
  rather part of the normal annual mortality rate, which in the UK is
  about 600,000 people per year. In other words, excess mortality would
  remain low.

  Professor Walter Ricciardi}, \textbf{``only 12\% of death certificates
  have shown a direct causality from coronavirus''}, whereas in public
  reports ``all the people who die in hospitals with the coronavirus are
  deemed to be dying of the coronavirus''. This means that Italian death
  figures reported by the media have to be reduced by \emph{at least a
  factor of 8} to obtain actual deaths \emph{caused by} the virus. Thus
  one ends up with at most a few dozen deaths per day, compared to an
  overall daily mortality of 1800 deaths and up to 20,000 flu deaths per
  year.

  The mortality profile remains puzzling from a virological point of
  view because, in contrast to influenza viruses, children are spared
  and men are affected about twice as often as women. On the other hand,
  this profile corresponds to
  \href{http://www.gbe-bund.de/gbe10/abrechnung.prc_abr_test_logon?p_uid=gast\&p_aid=0\&p_knoten=FID\&p_sprache=D\&p_suchstring=820}{natural

  The younger test-positive deceased almost always had severe

  an unrecognized leukemia, whose typical complications include severe

\item
  The decisive factor in assessing the danger of the disease is
  therefore \emph{not} the number of test-positive persons and deceased,
  which is often mentioned in the media, but the number of people
  actually and unexpectedly developing or dying \emph{from pneumonia}
  (so-called excess mortality). So far, this value remains very low in

According to the
\href{https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-decessi-italia}{latest
data} of the Italian National Health Institute ISS, the average age of
the positively-tested deceased in Italy is currently about 81 years.
10\% of the deceased are over 90 years old. 90\% of the deceased are
over 70 years old.

80\% of the deceased had suffered from two or more chronic diseases.
50\% of the deceased had suffered from three or more chronic diseases.
The chronic diseases include in particular cardiovascular problems,
diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer.

Less than 1\% of the deceased were healthy persons, i.e. persons without
pre-existing chronic diseases. Only about 30\% of the deceased are
women.

The Italian Institute of Health moreover
\href{https://youtu.be/0M4kbPDHGR0?t=210}{distinguishes} between those
who died \emph{from} the coronavirus and those who died \emph{with} the
coronavirus. In many cases it is not yet clear whether the persons died
from the virus or from their pre-existing chronic diseases or from a
combination of both.

The two Italians deceased under 40 years of age (both 39 years old) were
a cancer patient and a diabetes patient with additional complications.
In these cases, too, the exact cause of death was not yet clear (i.e. if
from the virus or from their pre-existing diseases).

The partial overloading of the hospitals is due to the general rush of
patients and the increased number of patients requiring special or
intensive care. In particular, the aim is to stabilize respiratory
function and, in severe cases, to provide anti-viral therapies.

(\textbf{Update}: The Italian National Institute of Health published a
\href{https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Report-COVID-2019_17_marzo-v2.pdf}{statistical
report} on test-positive patients and deceased, confirming the above
data.)

\textbf{The following aspects should also be taken into account:}

Northern Italy has one of the oldest populations and the
\href{https://twitter.com/esa/status/1238480433047916545}{worst air
quality} in Europe, which had already led to an
\href{https://www.thelocal.it/20170131/our-lungs-are-breaking-smog-levels-way-above-safe-limits-in-northern-italy}{increased
number} of respiratory diseases and deaths in the past and is likely an
additional risk factor in the current epidemic.

South Korea, for instance, has experienced a much milder course than
Italy and has already passed the peak of the epidemic. In South Korea,
only about 70 deaths with a positive test result have been reported so
far. As in Italy, those affected were mostly high-risk patients.

The few dozen test-positive Swiss deaths so far were also high-risk
patients with chronic diseases, an average age of more than 80 years and
a maximum age of 97 years, whose exact cause of death, i.e. from the
virus or from their pre-existing diseases, is not yet known.

Furthermore, studies have shown that the internationally used virus test
kits\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2095096/}{may
give a false positive result} in some cases. In these cases, the persons
may \emph{not} have contracted the new coronavirus, but presumably one
of the many existing human coronaviruses that are part of the annual
(and currently ongoing) common cold and flu epidemics.

Thus the most important indicator for judging the danger of the disease
is \emph{not} the frequently reported number of positively-tested
persons and deaths, but the number of persons actually and unexpectedly
developing or dying *from pneumonia (*so-called excess mortality).

According to all current data, for the healthy general population of
school and working age, a mild to moderate course of the Covid-19
disease can be expected. Senior citizens and persons with existing
chronic diseases should be protected. The medical capacities should be
optimally prepared.
