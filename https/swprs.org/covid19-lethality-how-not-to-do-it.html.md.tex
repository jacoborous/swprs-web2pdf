A German medical professor claims the Covid-19 infection fatality rate
(IFR) is
\href{https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Wie-gefaehrlich-ist-Covid-19-im-Vergleich-zur-saisonalen-Grippe-4790313.html}{``five
to ten times higher''} than the IFR of seasonal influenza. But he makes
two classic mistakes.

He first compares the seasonal influenza IFR (up to 0.1\%) to early
model predictions of the Covid19 IFR. But these early model predictions
turned out to be
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{completely
unrealistic} (see above). Besides, even the US CDC in May reduced its
(still conservative) best-estimate Covid IFR
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html}{to
just 0.26\%}.

He then claims antibody studies in Brazil and Spain showed an IFR of 1\%
or more. But they didn't: the professor confuses the so-called
\textbf{``crude IFR''} (deaths divided by infections in a study group)
with the \textbf{population-based IFR}, which is adjusted for the age
and risk profile of a population.

This distinction is crucial, as Covid-19 mostly affects elderly high
risk groups: in fact, 40\% to 80\% of ``Covid-related'' deaths
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#care-homes}{occurred
in nursing homes}. But if ten of one hundred nursing patients die, this
doesn't mean 10\% of the whole population will die.

As an example, the famous \textbf{Diamond Princess} cruise ship with its
mostly elderly passengers had a crude IFR of about 1.5\%. Based on this
value, Stanford professor John Ioannidis, already in March, calculated a
population-based Covid IFR
\href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/}{of
about 0.13\%} for the US society as a whole.

The German professor does mention the German antibody study of the
Gangelt hotspot which showed a population-based IFR of 0.36\%. The
professor doesn't mention, however, that this
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{was an upper
bound}: the adjusted IFR was 0.27\% and the median age of death was 81
years.

Most antibody studies showed a population-based IFR
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/}{between 0.1\%
and 0.3\%}, which is comparable to a severe influenza. In fact, for
people under 50, the Covid19 IFR is \emph{rather lower} than for
influenza. A few hotspots did show locally higher IFRs of up to 0.7\%,
but these places usually were affected by a collapse in elderly care due
to infections or panic.

More recently, immunological research has revealed that serological
(i.e. blood) antibody studies
\href{https://swprs.org/coronavirus-antibody-tests-show-only-one-fifth-of-infections/}{detect
at most 20\% of infections}, as most people neutralize the coronavirus
with their mucosal or cellular immune system without even needing to
develop (permanent) antibodies in the blood.

This means the real Covid19 IFR may drop \textbf{well below 0.1\%} and
thus into the range of seasonal influenza. It also means Covid19
``immunity passports'' and mandatory vaccines won't work. And it
explains why even hotspots like NYC and Stockholm found antibody values
no higher than 20\%.

Despite its rather low lethality (IFR), \textbf{mortality} can still
reach locally and temporarily very high levels if the coronavirus is
spreading fast and manages to infect high risk groups in care homes and
hospitals, as indeed happened in many hotspots like northern Italy or
eastern France.

But even so, \textbf{cumulative all-cause mortality} since the beginning
of the year even in hard-hit countries like the US and the UK or in
Sweden (without a lockdown) remained
\href{https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/\#overall-mortality}{in
the range of a strong influenza season}. Countries like Germany and
Switzerland saw a mild ``influenza season''.

The following chart shows that global Covid-19 mortality is comparable
to the notorious Swine Flu
\href{https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/05/world-health-organization-swine-flu-pandemic-opinions-contributors-michael-fumento.html}{``non-pandemic''}
of 2009/10 and remains an order of magnitude below the flu pandemics of
1957 (Asian flu) and 1968 (Hong Kong flu). These were serious, but life
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/}{still
went on as normal}.

Importantly, while these death rates are population-adjusted, they
aren't even age-adjusted: the age group most affected by Covid-19 today
(80+) hardly existed back in the 1950s. Hence adjusting for age would
make Covid-19 look even less dramatic in comparison.

In contrast, the UN warns that due to the unprecedented
\textbf{political response} to Covid-19, half of the world's workers or
\textbf{1.6 billion people} are now at
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/half-of-worlds-workers-at-immediate-risk-of-losing-livelihood-due-to-coronavirus}{immediate
risk of losing their livelihood}. In the US alone there are already
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment-insurance-filings-economy-coronavirus-recession-2020-6}{46
million unemployment claims}.
