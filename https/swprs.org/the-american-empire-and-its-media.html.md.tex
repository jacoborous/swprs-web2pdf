Largely unbeknownst to the general public, executives and top
journalists of almost all major US media outlets have long been members
of the influential Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

Established in 1921 as a private, bipartisan organization to
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/21/archives/is-it-a-club-seminar-presidium-invisible-government-the-council-on-.html}{``awaken
America to its worldwide responsibilities''}, the CFR and its close to
5000 elite members for decades have shaped US foreign policy and public
discourse about it. As a well-known Council member famously
\href{http://carnegieendowment.org/1998/06/01/benevolent-empire-pub-275}{explained},
they transformed the American republic into a global empire, albeit a
``beneÂ­volent'' one.

Based on official membership rosters, the following illustration depicts
for the first time the extensive media network of the CFR and its two
major international affiliate organizations: the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group}{Bilderberg Group}
(mainly covering the US and Europe) and the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateral_commission}{Trilateral
Commission} (covering North America, Europe and East Asia), both
established by Council leaders to foster elite cooperation at the global
level.

\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cfr-media-network-hdv-spr.png}{\includegraphics{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cfr-media-network-hdv-spr.png?w=736}}\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cfr-media-network-hdv-spr.png}{Click

In a column entitled
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1993/10/30/ruling-class-journalists/761e7bf8-025d-474e-81cb-92dcf271571e/}{``Ruling
Class Journalists''}, former \emph{Washington Post} senior editor and
ombudsman Richard Harwood described the Council and its members
approvingly as ``the nearest thing we have to a ruling establishment in
the United States''.

Harwood continued: ``The membership of these journalists in the Council,
however they may think of themselves, is an acknowledgment of their
active and important role in public affairs and of their ascension into
the American ruling class. They do not merely analyze and interpret
foreign policy for the United States; they help make it. () They are
part of that establishment whether they like it or not, sharing most of
its values and world views.''

Media researcher Noam Chomsky explained this aspect in an
\href{https://chomsky.info/199710__/}{essay from 1997}: ``The point is
that they wouldn't be there unless they had already demonstrated that
nobody has to tell them what to write because they are going say the
right thing anyway. () They have been through the socialization
system.''

However, media personalities constitute only about five percent of the
overall CFR network. As the following illustration shows, key members of
the private Council on Foreign Relations have included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  several US Presidents and Vice Presidents of both parties;
\item
  almost all Secretaries of State, Defense, and the Treasury;
\item
  many high-ranking commanders of the US military and NATO;
\item
  some of the most influential Members of Congress (notably in foreign
  \& security policy);
\item
  almost all National Security Advisors, CIA Directors, Ambassadors to
  the U.N., Chairs of the Federal Reserve, Presidents of the World Bank,
  and Directors of the National Economic Council;
\item
  many prominent academics, especially in key fields such as Economics
  and Political Science;
\item
  many top executives of Wall Street, policy think tanks, universities,
  NGOs, and Hollywood;
\item
  as well as the key members of both the 9/11 Commission and the Warren
  Commission (JFK)
\end{itemize}

Harvard economist and Kennedy supporter, John K. Galbraith,
\href{http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/73633/the-best-and-the-brightest-by-david-halberstam/9780449908709/}{confirmed}
the Council's influence: ``Those of us who had worked for the Kennedy
election were tolerated in the government for that reason and had a say,
but foreign policy was still with the Council on Foreign Relations
people.''

Princeton University professor and former CFR member Stephen F. Cohen
\href{https://www.thenation.com/article/the-american-bipartisan-policy-establishment-declares-its-second-cold-war-vs-russia-after-years-of-denying-it/}{described}
the Council as ``America's single most important non-governmental
foreign-policy organization'', whose primary role is to ``define the
accepted, legitimate, orthodox parameters of discussion.'' According to
Cohen, ``the CFR really is what the Soviets used to call the very
top-level of the Nomenklatura.''

And no less than John J. McCloy, the longtime chairman of the Council
and advisor to several US presidents,
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/21/archives/is-it-a-club-seminar-presidium-invisible-government-the-council-on-.html}{recalled}
about his time in Washington: ``Whenever we needed a man we thumbed
through the roll of the Council members and put through a call to New
York {[}i.e., the CFR headquarters{]}.''

\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/cfr-imperial-council-hdv.png}{\includegraphics{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/cfr-imperial-council-hdv.png?w=736}}

German news magazine \emph{Der Spiegel} once
\href{http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/41389590}{described}
the CFR as the ``most influential private institution of the United
States and the Western world'' and a ``politburo of capitalism''. Both
the Roman-inspired logo of the Council (top right in the illustration
above), as well as its slogan (\emph{ubique} -- omnipresent), appear to
emphasize this ambition.

In his famous article about
\href{http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/WQ_VOL2_SU_1978_Article_05.pdf}{``The
American Establishment''}, political columnist Richard H. Rovere noted:
``The directors of the CFR make up a sort of Presidium for that part of
the Establishment that guides our destiny as a nation. () {[}I{]}t
rarely fails to get one of its members, or at least one of its allies,
into the White House. In fact, it generally is able to see to it that
both nominees are men acceptable to it.''

Until recently, this assessment indeed was justified. Thus, in 1993
former CFR director George H.W. Bush was followed by CFR member Bill
Clinton, who in turn was followed by CFR ``family member'' George W.
Bush. In 2008, CFR member John McCain lost against CFR candidate of
choice, Barack Obama, who
\href{http://observer.com/2016/10/obama-makes-first-appearance-in-wikileaks-receives-admin-list-from-big-banker/}{received}
the names of his entire Cabinet already one month prior to his election
by CFR Senior Fellow (and Citigroup banker) Michael Froman. Froman later
negotiated the TPP and TTIP trade agreements, before returning to the
CFR as a Distinguished Fellow.

It was not until the 2016 election that the Council couldn't,
apparently, prevail. At any rate, not yet.

\textbf{Update 2018}: In January 2018, a few weeks before his internet
access was cut off, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange
\href{https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/assange-tweet.png}{shared}
the above CFR media chart on his Twitter account.

\textbf{Update 2019}: It became known that deceased billionaire sex
trafficker Jeffrey Epstein had been, until 2009, a member and
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/council-on-foreign-relations-another-beneficiary-of-epstein-largesse-grapples-with-how-to-handle-his-donations/2019/09/10/1d5630e2-d324-11e9-86ac-0f250cc91758_story.html}{donor}
of both the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission.
