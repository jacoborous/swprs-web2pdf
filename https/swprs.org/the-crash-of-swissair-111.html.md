# The Crash of Swissair 111

<div class="post-content clear">

![Flight route of Swissair 111 (Source:
SRF)](https://swprs.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/swissair-111.png?w=736)

**Published**: December 2018  
**Languages**: [German](https://swprs.org/der-absturz-swissair-111/),
[English](https://swprs.org/the-crash-of-swissair-111/)

It is the biggest disaster in Swiss aviation history: On 2 September
1998, near the Canadian Halifax, Swissair Flight 111 from NYC to Geneva
crashed into the Atlantic with 229 people on board. The cause of the
crash has never been clarified. Yet for Swiss media, the case remains
taboo.

In its 2003 investigation report, the Canadian Transportation Safety
Authority (TSB) came to the conclusion that a short circuit in the
entertainment system cabling probably led to a fire in the cockpit,
which caused the plane to crash within minutes.

However, in 2011 a forensic expert from the Canadian Federal Police RCMP
involved in the investigation came to public attention as a
whistleblower and presented new facts that questioned the investigation
report and suggested sabotage or an attack as the cause of the crash.
Six years later, he published his findings and original documents in
book form.

**The following list summarizes his main statements:**

1.  After only a few days and despite initial indications of a possible
    crime, the investigation management decided to treat the crash
    exclusively as an accident and not to initiate a criminal
    investigation.
2.  An external metal expert, who was commissioned to investigate the
    site of the fire, found unusually high levels of magnesium residue,
    which indicated that a high-temperature thermite incendiary device
    had been used. However, the expert had to rewrite his report several
    times at the behest of the investigators until all evidence of a
    possible incendiary device was removed. Magnesium was no longer
    mentioned in the investigation report.
3.  The fire expert of the American FAA aviation authority and other
    experts also suspected the use of an incendiary device due to the
    damage.
4.  Test experiments, which were intended to prove that the burning
    insulation material alone could melt the aircraft’s aluminium frame,
    had to be adjusted on the instructions of the investigators until
    completely unrealistic conditions were reached.
5.  A piece of molten metal from the aircraft was disposed of during the
    test.
6.  The recorded voice data did not indicate a failure of the
    entertainment system as would be expected in the event of a short
    circuit. Rather, the examination of the wiring indicated that the
    defects were a result of the fire and not its cause.
7.  The aircraft maintenance check revealed that a new employee with a
    demonstrably false identity was present during the cleaning and
    handling of the aircraft at New York Airport and did not show up for
    work afterwards.
8.  According to cargo documents, the plane was supposed to carry
    diamonds with an insurance value of $300 million, but when the
    wreckage was recovered, [they were
    untraceable](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/the-mystery-of-swissair-flight-111-s-diamond-cargo-1.1051965).
9.  In the absence of a criminal investigation, no detailed profiling of
    the passengers was carried out, although [some prominent
    persons](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/swissair-crash-may-not-have-been-an-accident-ex-rcmp-1.1019738)
    were on board on the flight from New York to Geneva.
10. During the investigation, the whistleblower was asked by his
    superiors to manipulate his police investigation protocols.

In 2011, Canadian television CBC and Swiss television SRF produced a
[joint documentary film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9rVKWsMv_g) in
which the whistleblower and the metal expert had their say for the first
time. The SRF journalist in charge also spoke in advance to two renowned
European aviation accident experts, who also criticised the official
investigation report.

Nevertheless, Swiss television surprisingly [decided
against](http://www.news.ch/SRF+strahlt+Halifax+Doku+nicht+aus/508488/detail.htm)
broadcasting the documentary: They did not want to “spread speculation”,
said the then editor-in-chief. Other Swiss media [tried to
portray](https://www.nzz.ch/ein_einzelkaempfer_will_keine_ruhe_geben-1.12534482)
the Canadian investigator as a “lone wolf” or “conspiracy theorist”. The
then Swissair spokeswoman, however, who had insight into the
whistleblower’s extensive documents, [was
shocked](http://www.news.ch/SRF+strahlt+Halifax+Doku+nicht+aus/508488/detail.htm):
“What he said was untouchable”.

The reason for the Swiss media’s lack of interest, which continues to
this day, is not obvious. The years from 1996 to 1999 were a
[particularly difficult
time](https://interaktiv.bernerzeitung.ch/2018/schweizer-privatagenten/)
for Swiss foreign policy. The – [also
unexplained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_massacre) – Luxor
attack in November 1997 on a mainly Swiss travel group also fell during
this phase.

And three years after Halifax, the attacks of 11 September 2001
occurred, in which, [according to
critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_controlled_demolition_conspiracy_theories)
of the official account, thermite could also have been used.
